										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google for Startups will host its Canadian accelerator <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/accelerators/canada" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">program</a> virtually. The original aim for the three-month program was to host two cohorts in 2020. Now, it will be completing one, which will begin in September.</p>
<blockquote><p>“While the program’s three-month timeline will remain the same, the content rollout will be distributed equally across each week.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The accelerator’s first cohort, which was expected to begin in April, was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Google Accelerator, the <a href="https://betakit.com/google-to-launch-first-canadian-accelerator-in-kitchener-waterloo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first</a> such in Canada,  will now run from September 8 to November 27. Its content will remain the same, including mentorship and technical support, although it will be distributed virtually instead of in person.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re committed to supporting Canadian startups across the country, and we’ve updated our program so that the virtual experience will still deliver on technical project support, deep dives and workshops, as well as mentorship,” said Ashley Francisco, Canada startup ecosystem lead at Google.</p>
<p>“While the program’s three-month timeline will remain the same, the content rollout will be distributed equally across each week, to help participants manage additional priorities and responsibilities during this time,” Francisco added. </p>
<p>Accelerator programs across Canada have been <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-innovation-hubs-close-doors-to-help-prevent-the-spread-of-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forced online</a> due to current health regulations mandating physical distancing. Many pitch days and demo days, such as Techstars’ <a href="https://betakit.com/techstars-to-hold-startup-weekend-virtually-as-it-shifts-event-focus-to-covid-19-solutions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Startup Weekend</a> or Startup Canada&#8217;s <a href="https://betakit.com/startup-canadas-canadian-export-challenge-to-be-held-virtually-due-to-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canadian Export Challenge</a> have also been held online.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/accelerator-centre-to-fund-eight-startups-in-covid-19-cohort-of-jumpstart-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Accelerator Centre to fund eight startups in COVID-19 cohort of JumpStart program</a></strong></p>
<p>Google <a href="https://betakit.com/google-to-launch-first-canadian-accelerator-in-kitchener-waterloo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> its accelerator targeted toward early-stage tech startups in Kitchener-Waterloo in March. The program represents the tech giant’s first accelerator in Canada and the 12th globally. Eight to 10 startups are expected to participate in the 2020 cohort. </p>
<p>At the time of the announcement, Steven Woods, senior engineering director at Google and Waterloo site lead, called the Toronto-Waterloo corridor “the perfect place for [Google] to expand our footprint, and help grow the next generation of founders in Canada.”</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://betakit.com/googles-new-kitchener-waterloo-accelerator-reflects-evolving-commitment-to-canada/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with BetaKit</a>, Francisco, who is leading the accelerator program in Canada, called the move “a new evolution for Google and our presence in Canada.”</p>
<p>Google said it hopes the new virtual format will benefit startups outside of Ontario, which may have had challenges working out of Kitchener-Waterloo for the program.</p>
<p>As part of making the accelerator virtual, Google for Startups has extended the application deadline to June 30. Applicant selection will be announced on the week of August 17. The organization said it will continue to monitor health guidelines for potential future events.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada’s Department of Finance recently held a consultation process on the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CEWS</a>), looking for feedback from businesses, labour representatives, and non-profits. The federal government undertook the consultation as the program has seen lower uptake than initially anticipated.</p>
<blockquote><p>Only $9.36 billion has been deployed as part of the $73 billion wage subsidy program.</p></blockquote>
<p>The department launched the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/consultations/2020/canada-emergency-wage-subsidy-consultation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consultation</a> on May 25, aimed at gathering advice on potential changes to the program, asking for commentary on the program’s accessibility challenges, barriers to rehiring workers, and overall effectiveness. The consultation closed on June 5.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the consultation, the Council of Canadian Innovators (<a href="https://www.canadianinnovators.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CCI</a>) conducted a survey of 330 tech CEOs about their experience accessing the wage subsidy. The group provided recommendations to the federal government on how the uptake of the CEWS can be adapted to support the Canadian tech sector.</p>
<p>The CEWS provides employers with 75 percent of employee wages for up to 24 weeks, retroactive from March 15 to August 29. The program has seen slower than expected uptake since launching. According to the federal government’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-statistics.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reporting</a>, about 322,000 of the <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/online-calculator-to-help-businesses-determine-eligibility-for-covid-19-wage-subsidy-released-by-feds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anticipated</a> one million wage subsidy applications have been approved, and only $9.36 billion has been deployed as part of the $73 billion program.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been urging companies to take advantage of the CEWS, noting that it will continue to be available as the Canadian economy begins to open up. The prime minister has pointed to the importance of the program as less people require support through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).</p>
<p>Similar to previous recommendations, CCI’s survey found that tech CEOs want the federal government to expand the eligibility criteria for the CEWS, so that more small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can access the program. Although some of the criteria were <a href="https://betakit.com/feds-work-to-revise-wage-subsidy-but-canadian-tech-says-it-needs-more/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relaxed</a> in April, CCI found that 56 percent of respondents were are still ineligible for the CEWS. Twenty five persent of respondents were ineligible for both CEWS and IRAP’s <a href="https://betakit.com/as-applications-open-here-are-the-details-of-the-new-250-million-covid-19-irap-subsidy-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Innovation Assistance Program</a> (IAP).</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/report-one-quarter-of-canadian-startups-have-made-layoffs-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One-quarter of Canadian startups have made layoffs amid COVID-19</a></strong></p>
<p>Ineligibility mostly affects pre-revenue tech companies that cannot demonstrate the required 30 percent revenue decline, or companies whose employees are usually contractors, the survey found. Nearly three quarters (72 percent) of respondents that were ineligible for the wage subsidy said their company would rehire their entire staff if they became eligible.</p>
<p>“Most SMEs do not generate monthly income statements and instead they track key quantifiable activities, such as bookings, net new subscribers, units shipped, or billable hours, that vary from business to business and sector to sector,” CCI said, adding the requirement to show a 30 percent revenue decline is “not appropriate” for all high-growth firms in the tech sector.</p>
<blockquote><p>CCI found that one-quarter of respondents are still ineligible for any wage subsidy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The organization’s second recommendation to the government is to extend the availability of the CEWS to December 2020. Last month, the government <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2020/05/government-extends-the-canada-emergency-wage-subsidy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extended</a> the program another 12 weeks to August 29, in an effort to allow more businesses and organizations to retain or rehire employees.</p>
<p>“By extending CEWS to December 2020, the government will be giving companies the confidence they need to hire new workers, knowing that if their monthly business activities do decline, the wage subsidy will be there to keep their workers on [the] payroll,” CCI said. </p>
<p>The third recommendation from CCI is to focus the wage subsidy on companies that are investing and will promise to continue investing in research and development (R&#038;D). A survey conducted by the organization in <a href="https://betakit.com/nearly-half-of-canadian-tech-companies-report-decrease-in-value-due-to-covid-19-survey-finds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">May</a> indicated that intellectual property (IP) investments and company valuations have declined during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Higher valuation reduces the chance of the company being acquired too early at a low price, and also makes future investment of [foreign multinational enterprises] in the Canadian companies less impactful on the Canadian ownership of the company,” CCI stated. </p>
<p>The organization added that because IP and R&#038;D investments are indicators of sustainable revenue growth, focusing the CEWS on companies that have demonstrated a certain threshold of R&#038;D investment over the past four quarters would aid in the country’s economic recovery. </p>
<p>The government has noted the results of the consultation process will help inform “potential changes” to the CEWS. The Department of Finance has not indicated when the findings might be shared publicly. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Government of Canada and the province of Québec on Monday announced a new $50 million fund meant to support small business owners in the City of Montreal.</p>
<p>The funds will be administered by PME MTL, Montréal&#8217;s business support network. The federal government is providing $30 million of the overall fund, through Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions (CED). The capital is part of the recently launched Regional Relief and Recovery Fund (RRRF).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We must support entrepreneurs to ensure the survival of our commercial arteries, especially downtown.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The remainder of the fund will be provided by the Government of Québec, through its Emergency Assistance to Small and Medium-Sized Businesses program. A sum of $40 million was previously granted to the city through this program as well. </p>
<p>According to CED, the support is aimed at Montréal businesses ineligible for other existing federal measures related to COVID-19. The RRRF itself, part of the federal government&#8217;s COVID-19 response, was created to support regional and rural businesses that may not have existing relationships with financial institutions, or don’t qualify for other federal relief programs.</p>
<p>In May, CED <a href="https://betakit.com/government-reveals-details-on-962-million-regional-development-agencies-covid-19-funding/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">received</a> $211 million of the $962 million, which was divided between the six RDAs across Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;To enable Montréal&#8217;s economy to bounce back fully, we must support entrepreneurs to ensure the survival of our commercial arteries, especially downtown,&#8221; said Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages Mélanie Joly. &#8220;The collaboration of all players in the business community and the different levels of government is primordial in getting through this crisis and kickstarting our economy.&#8221;</p>

<p>PME MTL is an organization that offers a range of services to entrepreneurs located on the Island of Montreal. Its services span startups, growth, expert advise, training, and financial support.</p>
<p>The funding is in addition to the amounts already provided to the City of Montreal businesses. In early May, The City announced $2 million in the form of grants to entrepreneurs in the retail sector and $2 million to support for social economy businesses. Since the beginning of COVID-19, Québec has also committed to cover for six months the interest portion of loans taken out by businesses from PME MTL through the Fonds PME MTL, the Fonds Locaux de Solidarité, the Fonds de Commercialisation des innovations and the Fonds d&#8217;aide d&#8217;urgence. Since the beginning of 2020, Montréal has also reportedly recapitalized the PME MTL network&#8217;s funds up to $8.2 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Invixium, a Toronto-based biometric security products manufacturer that focuses on access control and workforce digitalization technology, has closed $3 million in financing.</p>
<p>The funding was raised from Export Development Canada (EDC), as well as existing investors McRock Capital, BDC Capital, and Connecticut Innovations. The company plans to use the capital to expand its sales and marketing efforts and explore growth opportunities, after reporting demand has surged for touchless and elevated body temperature detection.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We plan to lead the market with our touchless biometric solutions for workforce management and worksite access control.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“We plan to lead the market with our touchless biometric solutions for workforce management and worksite access control and will continue to add innovative features like temperature detection to our solution as a COVID-19 response,” said Shiraz Kapadia, founder and CEO of Invixium. “I am honoured to have the backing of a prestigious group of investors who believe in our vision, company and technology.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Invixium is based in Toronto with an office in India. The startup is a global provider of advanced touchless biometric solutions and software analytics for access control and workforce digitalization. The company’s biometric solutions are targeted toward small businesses and large scale enterprises and can be used within industries that require indoor and outdoor deployment in rugged harsh environments. In July, Invixium received <a href="https://betakit.com/invixium-raises-4-5-million-cad-in-in-debt-financing-for-biometric-security-solution/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$4.5 million CAD</a> in debt financing from CIBC Innovation Banking.</p>
<p>Through channel partners, Invixium’s product suite is sold into healthcare, corporate offices, utilities, airports, higher education, manufacturing, retail, data centres, banks, hotels and resorts, smart cities, and residential end-users. The company currently sells its product in more than 60 countries.</p>

<p>EDC participated in the round through its newly launched investment matching program, part of EDC’s portion of the Business Credit Availability Program (BCAP), <a href="https://betakit.com/details-on-edc-bdc-issuing-larger-loans-to-medium-sized-businesses-through-expanded-bcap/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">created</a> in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>Launched on a trial basis in April, BCAP aims to provide urgently needed capital by matching up to $5 million CAD of investment from venture capital, private equity, and corporate investment partners for small-and-medium-sized enterprises that export their products from Canada. Invixium is among the first companies to receive funding from the investment matching program. Waterloo-based Clearpath Robotics, which <a href="https://betakit.com/clearpath-robotics-raises-40-million-cad-series-c-for-industrial-robot-division/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently raised</a> a $40 million CAD, also received funding through the program.</p>
<p>“Invixium exemplifies the Canadian innovation EDC is supporting, especially during this current crisis, when we’re focused on bringing liquidity into the market,” said EDC’s executive vice president and chief business officer, Carl Burlock. “When COVID-19 hit, Invixium turned their focus to a product that will help keep people safe in their workplaces. We’re looking forward to working with the company as they grow and benefit from our investment matching program.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of the thousands of Canadian venture deals produced from 2014 to 2019, so few Black women founders raised money that these figures are very close to nothing.</p>
<p>Venture capital-backed funding has almost doubled since 2014 from $2 billion to $3.3 billion in 2017 and that year showed us that 40 percent of all venture capital went to just 10 companies.  Twenty-nineteen was a <a href="https://betakit.com/report-canadian-vc-investments-set-record-in-2019-as-tech-sector-dominates/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">record-breaking</a> year for the VC space with an astounding $6.2 billion CAD invested over 539 deals, a 69 percent increase than the <a href="https://central.cvca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CVCA_EN_Canada_VC_2019_Final-Mar13.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$3.7 billion</a> CAD invested in 2018 and more than 3 times the market analysis in 2013. Quarter 4 in 2019 saw the highest amount of venture-backed deals, with 144 total deals and over $1.6 billion invested.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the tech realms, investors do not back Black women-led startups.</p></blockquote>
<p>Compared to our south of the border counterparts figures, which are still very low, in 2018, <a href="https://www.projectdiane.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">11 African American women</a> raised $1 million in venture capital funding, which works out to about 0.2 percent of all venture funding in 2018.</p>
<p>Of those few that have raised money, the average amount of funding is <a href="https://www.projectdiane.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$36,000</a>. That&#8217;s compared to the average startup, usually founded by a white male, that typically fails, which raises millions on average in venture funding. While Canada ranks third globally (second to the US and China) as far as the amount of VC capital invested annually, it ranks 13th in creating business unicorns, which by definition is when one outstanding business is created for every $100 million invested.</p>
<p>One of the challenges Canadians VC’s face is making decisions when it comes to what they’re willing to invest in. In order to make the best decisions, investors and VC’s alike (and everyone else for that matter) need accurate data that show projections of the best future investments. As VC’s are on a quest to invest capital efficiently, they prioritize the businesses they feel have the potential to become the next billion-dollar businesses.</p>

<p>For minority founders, in particular Black Canadian women, their businesses are deemed <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/02/190430/black-women-vc-funding-experiences" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uninvestable</a> due to a host of preconceived notions. To put it bluntly, the investment industry is historically <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/13/its-true-black-female-founders-receive-basically-zero-venture-capital/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">racist</a> and <a href="https://betakit.com/the-wait-is-over-for-women-entrepreneurs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">misogynist</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Black women in the US today comprise the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs, with over 1.5 million businesses — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/13/its-true-black-female-founders-receive-basically-zero-venture-capital/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 322 percent increase since 1997, generating over $44 billion a year in revenue</a> &#8211; in the tech realms, investors do not back Black women-led startups. </p>
<p>Even with the large funding gap, women of color, especially Black women and minority women, continue to dive into entrepreneurship, accounting for 89 percent of new businesses opened every day. We have a similar growing group of promising businesses led by Black founders <a href="https://www.ellecanada.com/fashion/shopping/black-owned-canadian-beauty-fashion-health-and-lifestyle-brands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here in Canada</a>, and now is the time for investors to better understand the nuances within these unique founders that provide their businesses massive growth potential.</p>
<p>In 2018, The Government of Canada attempted to bridge the funding gap faced by diverse women founders by allocating a series of grants to three hundred women-owned businesses across Canada. Aftermarket research through <a href="http://pitchbetter.ca" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pitch Better</a>, our independent research consulting firm, it was determined that two of the three hundred plus businesses who succeeded in securing the funding were led by Black women. This validates the theory that even though the Government may have tried to “level” the playing field, funding towards Black women, and this idea of creating space for “economic inclusion” within our communities, has unfortunately missed the mark.</p>
<blockquote><p>Black women are working smart, learning the tricks of the trade, and outperforming their competitors in almost every industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am the co-founder of tech startup Pitch Better, a market research solutions firm on a mission to provide women entrepreneurs with the educational tools to scale and build growth based companies. Since September 2019, we have consulted with over 250 Black women founders across Canada and have already begun through this work to identify the gaps preventing women founders of colour from securing investment capital to scale their businesses.</p>
<p>From founders who own skincare lines, to law practices, to tech-enabled courier companies, and innovative firms designing bio-medical solutions to health issues, the potential of the small business landscape for Black women founders is vast.</p>
<p>Among the types of entrepreneurs we’ve seen, there is a constant: Black women are working smart, learning the tricks of the trade, are over mentored, yet are <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/the-conversation-and-the-data-a-look-at-funding-to-black-founders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rarely funded and invested in</a>. They are a highly investable category of founders and it’s time the world caught up.</p>
<p>In early 2020, our firm developed the “FoundHers” research project, under <a href="http://sandpiper.vc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sandpiper Ventures</a> mentorship, to be able to conduct a formalized research study examining the investment outcomes of Black Women Founders across Canada. We know in theory that there is something not quite right about the investment opportunities given to these businesses. However, there is barely any empirical evidence collected in Canada, specifically to prove this.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/emotional-tax-for-people-of-colour-is-contributing-to-canadas-retention-problem/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Emotional tax” for people of colour is contributing to Canada’s retention problem</a></strong></p>
<p>Our end goal for the research findings is to produce a report similar to that of the <a href="https://www.visa.ca/en_CA/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases/shes-next-empowered-by-visa-launches-in-toronto-offering-canadian-women-entrepreneurs-tools-and-resources-to-help-them-thrive.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#She’sNext By Visa</a> project. Equipped with a team of expert women MBA’s and PhD researchers, the final product of this report will be a comprehensive list identifying Canada’s top growth and tech-based businesses led by Black women founders. </p>
<p>In addition to the findings from this research, there are several ways the trajectory for minority founders in Canada, particularly Black women, can be changed to be more inclusive. The federal government and investment community alike can demonstrate true allyship.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Canadian government must prioritize the collection of race-based data surrounding the outcomes of health, wealth, and overall well-being of all Canadians. Simply distinguishing non-Caucasian groups as “diverse” is no longer helpful or useful to the investment communities and for society overall. Black founders have a different set of socio-economic challenges and circumstances, but somehow <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/12/12/18136744/walker-company-procter-gamble-acquisition-tristan-walker-bevel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">manage to overcome and succeed</a>. As Canadian citizens, we need to know who they are and data is the only way we will ever see them.</p>
<p>Secondly, more private equity firms and private venture capital companies must adjust their leadership to better reflect the diverse communities of Canada. An <a href="https://www.straight.com/tech/1244911/canada-needs-more-women-leading-venture-capital-funds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inclusive firm</a> has a competitive advantage to compete in the global arena when its leadership team mirrors the dynamic nature of a multicultural society.</p>
<p>Thirdly, although a very small and sometimes obscure group, Canadian VC’s and investors need to be more intersectional in their investment practices and show up for minority founders building growth-based companies that show promise and resilience. Looking to the example of Sundial-owned brand Shea Moisture, which recently committed to investing in a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/sheamoisture-announces-1m-relief-fund-to-women-of-color-entrepreneurs-affected-by-coronavirus/ar-BB1267CQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$1 million COVID-19 relief fund</a> for Black women-led businesses, we see that Black investors in the US with the means are getting behind women founders at an increasing rate.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/the-wait-is-over-for-women-entrepreneurs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The wait is over for women entrepreneurs</a></strong></p>
<p>Finally, Black women are and have been doing the work to build strong solid competitive businesses, contributing to our economies in the billions. Shontay Lundy, the founder of Black Girl Sunscreen, a skincare line for Black women and the only indie brand carried across 200 Target stores, just raised $1 million from a private female fund, now demonstrating a market value of $5 million.</p>
<p>The past few weeks have shown us that systemic anti-Black racism and discriminatory practices are alive and well across Canada and the US. Fortune 1000 companies and large institutions alike have banded together to display inclusive allyship and commitment to causes that gravely impact the outcomes of the Black community. Outside of the novelty and tokenism of the #GeorgeFloyd protests, it would be monumental to witness a shift in the investment culture on a large scale. It won’t happen overnight, but things can gradually change, individual by individual. And if you’re reading this, it can begin with you.</p>
<p>Contribute to our Research Project <a href="https://fundly.com/foundhers-research-study" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> and help us build the data that supports the future and current Black women founders in Canada to thrive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vancouver-founded communications software company Slack has reported its financial results for the first quarter and provided its outlook for the fiscal year ending 2021. All numbers are in USD.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We see the current crisis accelerating&#8230;the transition from email to channel-based messaging platforms.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Slack’s total revenue reached $201.7 million, an increase of 50 percent year-over-year. The company added a record 12,000 net new paid customers in the quarter, bringing the total to 122,000 paid customers, an increase of 28 percent year over year, amid the widespread shift to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“We believe the long-term impact the three months and counting of working from home will have on the way we work is of generational magnitude,” said Stewart Butterfield, CEO and co-founder at Slack. “This will continue to catalyze adoption for the new category of channel-based messaging platforms we created and for which we are still the only enterprise-grade offering.”</p>
<p>In the quarter, the company hit another record with over 90,000 net new organizations on either a free or paid subscription plan, bringing the total of organizations on subscription plans to 750,000. </p>
<p>Of the 12,000 net new paid customers, Slack gained 963 paid customers with greater than $100,000 in annual recurring revenue, which is up 49 percent from the same quarter last year. Slack, which <a href="https://betakit.com/slack-shares-surge-after-direct-listing-on-the-nyse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">went public</a> on the New York Stock Exchange via direct listing last year, did not disclose a new daily active user count. </p>
<p>One of the new Slack customers is tech giant <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/04/amazon-licenses-slack-for-workers-as-slack-adopts-aws-video-call-tech.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, which will now have all of its employees to use Slack’s workplace collaboration tools. Slack is also updating its video-calling feature to take advantage of an Amazon web service called Chime as part of the companies’ partnership.</p>
<p>Slack’s calculated billings totalled $206.0 million, an increase of 38 percent year-over-year. Overall, the company saw an operating loss of $16.6 million for the quarter.</p>
<p>On April 21, Slack released the results of a survey it conducted on the shift to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey found that an estimated 16 million workers in the United States started working remotely due to COVID-19 as of March 27, however that number is likely now higher. </p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-tech-companies-stepping-up-to-help-remote-workers-survive-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canadian tech companies stepping up to help remote workers survive COVID-19</a></strong></p>
<p>In Canada, the pandemic has led some companies to consider adopting this new form of work as a permanent measure. Shopify, for example, recently <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-moving-vast-majority-of-employees-to-permanent-remote-work/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> the majority of its employees will work remotely even when the pandemic is over.</p>
<p>“We plan to continue to invest, as we see the current crisis accelerating digital transformation and the transition from email to channel-based messaging platforms over the medium term to long term,” said Allen Shim, Slack’s chief financial officer. “At the same time, we will manage the business prudently and with a goal of showing consistent operating leverage and progression toward being free cash flow positive.”</p>
<p>Although the COVID-19 pandemic may have led to an uptick in customers for Slack, the current uncertainty surrounding the global economy was cited as the company’s reason for withdrawing its outlook for calculated billings for the full fiscal year. The company projected revenue to reach between $206 million and $209 million for the following quarter, and revenue between $855 million and $870 million for the full year.</p>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxma3/slack-blog-post-worked-with-police" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vice</a> reported that Slack recently took down a company blog post explaining how a police department used Slack’s platform to share intelligence. Slack removed the post following global protests against racial inequality and police brutality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/iq/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">L’Institut quantique</a> (IQ), a research organization located at the University of Sherbrooke in Québec, is joining the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/network/overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM Q Network</a> as an IBM Q Hub. IQ will be the first Hub in Canada and the 14th globally.</p>
<blockquote><p>“With this initiative, many Québec organizations will be positioned to be global leaders.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The University of Sherbrooke has received $4.5 million in support from the Government of Québec to expand its quantum computing capacity as an IBM Q Hub. The funding will be used to secure cloud-based access to IBM&#8217;s quantum computing systems and software, including a 53-qubit system, currently the largest universal one available in the industry. </p>
<p>The first official member at IQ’s IBM hub is <a href="https://www.cmc.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CMC Microsystems</a>, which has a national network of universities and companies working in micro-nano technology innovation.</p>
<p>“This collaboration is a perfect fit for the researchers in our network,” said CMC Microsystems president and CEO Gordon Harling. “We firmly believe that the quantum space will be strategically important and with this initiative, many Québec organizations will be positioned to be global leaders.”</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/research-collaboration/programs/quantum-canada-survey-overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> from the federal Quantum Canada program, Canada’s public sector has invested more than $1 billion in quantum research and development over the last decade. However,  the country still reportedly faces limited engagement with industry and unclear mechanisms for commercialization as key challenges in the sector. </p>
<p>IBM quantum hubs are aimed to accelerate research, develop commercial quantum applications, and provide startups and other businesses with support, training, and enablement with IBM&#8217;s technical experts. Although IQ represents the first hub as part of this network, it is not the first time the IBM Q Network has joined forces with a Canadian university. </p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/ai-nation-quantum-machine-learning/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Machine learning could be Canada’s edge in the global quantum computing arms race</a></strong></p>
<p>In April 2019, IBM <a href="https://betakit.com/ibm-collaborating-with-university-of-waterloo-for-quantum-computing-research/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collaborated</a> with the University of Waterloo to develop programs to prepare students for careers in quantum, across science and business. That partnership focused on research projects with students and faculty to advance the foundational science, technology, and software required to enable more capable quantum systems. One Canadian member of the IBM Q Network s is Vancouver-based startup <a href="https://1qbit.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1QBit</a>.</p>
<p>IQ was created in 2016 after an <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-government-dedicates-900-million-to-helping-universities-become-world-leading-research-centres/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investment</a> from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund. The institute is focused on developing projects, training personnel, developing quantum technologies and entrepreneurship, engaging players in the sector, and fostering social awareness of challenges in quantum science. </p>
<p>“The IBM Q Hub at IQ is a tool for both fundamental research and the development of practical applications,” said Alexandre Blais, scientific director of IQ. “We want to build a quantum community of users where academia, private companies, and startups meet and connect.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eight new projects focused on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic are receiving investments from the British Columbia-based <a href="https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Technology Supercluster</a>. The funding for each project was not disclosed.</p>
<blockquote><p>One project will assess the feasibility of its on-the-spot screening technology for the detection of COVID-19.<br />
&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>These new projects are some of the 22 projects selected by the supercluster out of over 500 proposals received for its previously announced $60 million <a href="https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/new-covid-19-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">program</a> aimed to fight COVID-19, seven of which were <a href="https://betakit.com/1qbit-alayacare-among-latest-projects-to-receive-support-from-digital-technology-supercluster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> last week. The investment, drawn from the supercluster&#8217;s $153 million budget, is designed to address some of the biggest challenges faced by the country due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;As provinces reopen we must remain vigilant and continue to find effective ways to protect and support our frontline workers and use technologies to prevent and predict further outbreaks while supporting Canadians in the many ways they have been impacted by COVID-19,&#8221; said Sue Paish, CEO of the Digital Technology Supercluster.</p>
<p>The supercluster’s COVID-19 program is supported by the federal government’s Innovation Superclusters Initiative. In March, the government <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-government-refocuses-innovation-procurement-programs-in-fight-against-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">refocused</a> some of its innovation programs, including the Innovation Supercluster Initiative, to help in its fight against COVID-19. </p>
<p>Selected project teams are eligible to receive reimbursement of between 50 and 100 percent of total project costs. The supercluster will determine the specific co-investment rate for each selected project. The eight latest projects include:</p>
<p><strong>Digital Mental Health Tools for Healthcare Workers &#8211;</strong> This project, led by <a href="https://www.starlingminds.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Starling Minds</a>, aims to create a suite of interactive therapy tools to help healthcare organizations deliver mental healthcare support to workers.</p>

<p>The startup, which delivers medication from pharmacies directly to patients, has been <a href="https://www.pocketpills.com/blog/online-pharmacy/mobile-apps-to-use-during-lockdown-social-distancing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">touting</a> its platform during the pandemic as a way for customers to easily receive prescription medication while social distancing. Since the start of the pandemic, PocketPills claims usage tripled from late February to late March.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Healthcare has been slow to move online for a variety of reasons, but that&#8217;s changing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>“People wanting the convenience of free home delivery through apps or [the] web is a secular trend that is getting expedited with COVID-19,” Harj Samra, co-founder of PocketPills, told BetaKit. “Healthcare has been slow to move online for a variety of reasons, but that&#8217;s changing now and telemedicine, as well as digital pharmacies, are seeing significant tailwinds that are expediting adoption.”</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a renewed emphasis on telehealth and virtual care. In early May, the federal government committed over <a href="https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2020/05/03/prime-minister-announces-virtual-care-and-mental-health-tools" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$240.5 million</a> to online healthcare, which included mental health tools in addition to primary care. </p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/medical-organizations-look-to-assess-virtual-healthcare-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Medical organizations look to assess virtual healthcare technology</a></strong></p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/group-benefits/green-shield-canada-survey-reveals-growing-interest-in-virtual-healthcare-222275.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> conducted by Green Shield Canada suggests that there is increasing interest in virtual healthcare services, as the COVID-19 pandemic has hindered consumers from in-person interactions. Out of 500 Green Shield Canada health benefits plan members, 67 percent said they would fill a prescription form from an online pharmacy.</p>
<p>Four months after closing its <a href="https://betakit.com/pocketpills-closes-7-35-million-cad-series-a-as-it-looks-to-complete-national-expansion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$7.35 million</a> Series A, PocketPills claims it has grown over 100 percent since the end of 2019 and 500 percent since the same time last year. The company has also more than doubled it’s operational staff in the past three months and plans to hire 100 employees over the course of this year. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Digital pharmacies are seeing significant tailwinds that are expediting adoption.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In May, PocketPills also announced plans to move into a new 10,000 square-foot location in the coming months. The startup told BetaKit the space is in the design and construction phase, and it is expected to be completed by August, doubling the size of PocketPill’s current headquarters.</p>
<p>PocketPills has also entered partnerships with insurers and administrators like <a href="https://www.greenshield.ca/en-ca/news/stories/gsc-collaboration-with-pocketpills-set-to-spark-ongoing-digital-health-innovation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Green Shield Canada</a>, <a href="https://www.peoplecorporation.com/people-advantage/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">People Corporation</a>, and <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/04/02/1795375/0/en/PocketPills-Partners-with-Pacific-Blue-Cross-to-Bring-Accessible-Medication-to-British-Columbians.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pacific Blue Cross</a>. Over the last two months, the startup has brought on over 100 new insurance plan sponsors, which represents over 100,000 members. To keep up with demand, PocketPills has also started same-day deliveries in Vancouver, Toronto, and Winnipeg. </p>
<p>“Individuals want contactless service from the convenience of their home. Insurers and benefit advisors want digital healthcare solutions that are cost-effective,” Samra told BetaKit. “This is why we are seeing leaders in the space coming together to provide integrated [an] digital healthcare experience.”</p>
<p>The pandemic has also led to increased competition in the digital pharmacy market. <a href="https://pillway.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pillway</a>, for example, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to offer a personalized pharmacy experience for patients who take multiple medications a day, recently launched. </p>
<p>Pillway brands itself as more than a pre-sorting and delivery solution, using technology to help patients stay in touch with their doctors and remind users of refills and renewals and receive advice. The company’s service is currently available in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, with plans to roll out nationally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite being ranked in the top four, Canada has fallen one spot in StartupBlink’s 2020 global startup ecosystem <a href="https://report.startupblink.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rankings</a>, as major tech hubs Toronto and Vancouver have also seen their ecosystem rankings drop.</p>
<blockquote><p>StartupBlink said the main issue separating Canada from the top three countries is its ability to create unicorns and “highly popular” startups.</p></blockquote>
<p>The United States, United Kingdom, and Israel, along with Canada, once again all held on to the top four spots for countries with the strongest startup ecosystems. This year, both Toronto and Vancouver experienced a notable ranking decrease, with the former falling nine spots and the latter falling by 12. Toronto, Vancouver, and Montréal are listed in StartupBlink’s top 50 ecosystems, though there is now not a single Canadian hub in the top 20 cities. </p>
<p>In its rankings report, StartupBlink said the main issue separating Canada from the top three countries is Canada’s ability to create unicorns and “highly popular” startups. Notably,EdTech startup, <a href="https://www.applyboard.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ApplyBoard</a>, recently reached unicorn status after raising <a href="https://betakit.com/applyboard-raises-100-million-cad-claims-2-billion-unicorn-valuation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$100 million</a> and claiming a $2 billion valuation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://betakit.com/narwhal-list-2020-tracks-a-year-of-massive-raises-42-potential-unicorns/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2020 Narwhal List</a> also recently reported that Canada is on track to greatly improve its unicorn record, noting an increase from seven to 42 Canadian tech companies on track to surpass the $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p>“Canada has massive potential,” the report noted. “Considering the substantial interest of the relatively efficient public sector in the growth of the ecosystem, and relative abundance of resources, there is no reason Canadian startup ecosystems should not take an even more substantial role in creating massive global hubs.”</p>
<p>In StartupBlink’s 2019 <a href="https://betakit.com/canadas-tech-hubs-fall-in-startup-ecosystem-rankings-smaller-cities-show-promise/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>, Vancouver dropped six places to 24, and Toronto dropped by four places to 15. For 2020, Toronto ranks 24 globally, Vancouver ranks 37, and Montréal’s position remained the same as last year at 49. </p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/lack-of-vc-activity-caused-by-pandemic-not-reflected-in-q1-2020-says-cvcas-kim-furlong/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lack of VC activity caused by pandemic not reflected in Q1 2020, says CVCA’s Kim Furlong</a></strong></p>
<p>StartupBlink uses algorithms that analyze tens of thousands of data points to rank the startup ecosystems of 100 countries and 1,000 cities. The ranking algorithm was built in cooperation with its data partners at CrunchBase, Semrush, UNAIDS, and Meetup. More than 40 governments, municipalities, and economic development organizations also participated in the report.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There is no reason Canadian startup ecosystems should not take an even more substantial role in creating massive global hubs.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ottawa’s ranking increased by six spots to 57, which has the city approaching the top 50. Edmonton also moved up four spots to 91 and Calgary has ascended 14 spots to 97. This bring’s Canada’s total number of cities in the top 100 to six, which is a new record for the country’s startup ecosystem. </p>
<p>As for cities ranked in the top 150, Kitchener-Waterloo, Québec City, and Victoria registered a slight decline, while Kingston saw its ecosystem ranked 144. </p>
<p>The report cited the Edmonton Economic Development Corporation (EEDC) as a key driver for the city’s rise, adding that the public sector is expressing enthusiasm about local startups. Notably, Edmonton’s city council voted in December to change the EEDCs mandate and scale back the organization’s responsibilities. The city has since voted to form a new innovation entity independent of the EEDC.</p>
<p>In a new section of the report focused on COVID-19, Canada ranked third in the world for COVID–19 innovation, and Toronto ranked fourth in the world. StartupBlink noted that despite the city’s drop in the overall rankings, it still has the potential to be a global hub. Calgary also overperformed, ranking 70.</p>
<p>There is only one new Canadian entry to StartupBlink’s rankings in 2020: Oakville, ranked at 380. The decrease in the number of major Canadian city hubs means that Toronto is now ranked 10 in North America, after 9 cities from the USA, while Vancouver is regionally ranked15 and Montréal 19.</p>
<p>Canada now has 2.9 percent of the top 1,000 ecosystems globally. StartupBlink said in order for Canada to retain a high status globally, startups will have to be “less risk-averse” and adopt the mentality of entrepreneurs in the US.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://greeneye.ag/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Greeneye Technology</a>, an AgTech startup that offers an artificial intelligence-powered platform to help farmers detect and spray weeds in real-time, has raised a $7 million USD seed round.</p>
<blockquote><p>Panache Ventures met Greeneye during its time at Techstars Montréal, and participated in the startup’s pre-seed round in 2018.</p></blockquote>
<p>The round was led by <a href="https://www.jvpvc.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jerusalem Venture Partners</a>, and saw participation from Montréal-based <a href="https://www.panache.vc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Panache Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.techstars.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Techstars</a>, 2B Angels, One Way Ventures, Hyperplane Venture Capital, and Syngenta Ventures. The new funds will be used to advance product research and development while expanding Greeneye’s strategic partnerships with sprayer manufacturers and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Greeneye was founded in Tel Aviv, Israel by CEO Nadav Bocher in 2017. Bocher moved to Canada to <a href="https://betakit.com/techstars-announces-2018-montreal-ai-cohort/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">participate</a> in Techstars’ artificial intelligence accelerator in Montréal and has been based in the city for two years. The startup eventually opened an office in Montréal to lead business development.</p>
<p>The startup is developing a platform using artificial intelligence to detect and spray weeds in real-time. Greeneye said many farmers still spray their fields with a chemical-intensive treatment, without distinguishing between the crop, the bare soil, and the weeds, adding that this results in failed crops, that can significantly impact farmers.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to reduce the usage of chemicals that are being sprayed in agriculture, utilizing artificial intelligence to provide precise and targeted spraying in real-time, save money for farmers while increasing their productivity and profitability,” said Bocher.</p>
<p>“Our trials indicate that our technology reduces herbicide usage by 65 to 92 percent, which supports our mission to address these global agricultural challenges,” Bocher added.</p>

<p>Greeneye plans to use the new funds to commercialize its technology, deepen its analytics capabilities, and expand to additional spraying applications. JVP partner Michal Drayman and managing director of Syngenta Ventures, Shubhang Shankar, have joined Greeneye’s board.</p>
<p>This is the second round for Greeneye that Panache Ventures has participated in. David Dufresne, partner at Panache Ventures, told BetaKit the firm met Greeneye during its time at Techstars Montréal, and participated in the startup’s pre-seed round in December 2018. </p>
<p>“I like that a proudly Canadian firm led the pre-seed round with a solid group of co-investors in what I hope will become an AgTech success story,” Dufresne told BetaKit.</p>
<p>Panache Ventures is a seed-stage VC firm with offices in Montréal and Calgary, created by Dufresne, Patrick Lor, Mike Cegelski, and Nicolas Bouchard. In September, the firm closed <a href="https://betakit.com/panache-ventures-announces-final-close-of-inaugural-fund-at-58-million/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$58 million</a> for its inaugural fund.</p>
<p>Bocher told BetaKit although he is the only member of the company based in Montréal, Greeneye is looking to hire additional employees in Montréal and maintain its presence in the city.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://manzil.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Manzil</a>, a Toronto-based FinTech startup that offers halal financial solutions including mortgages, is offering the public a chance to invest in the company through a private placement on crowdfunding platform <a href="https://www.frontfundr.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FrontFundr</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Manzil says it has created financial products designed to be participatory, rather than predatory.</p></blockquote>
<p>The startup said opening up <a href="https://www.frontfundr.com/manzil" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investment</a> is meant to offer the public a chance to own a piece of Manzil, which calls itself “Canada’s first neo bank offering halal-certified products.” Founded in 2017, Manzil was created to help Canadian Muslims balance their financial needs with their ethical and spiritual obligations. </p>
<p>Manzil claims Canadian Muslims have a spending power of $20 billion dollars, yet have low participation in homeownership. The startup said this can be because many financing products don’t always conform with the ethical and religious obligations of the Islamic faith.</p>
<p>“For far too long, Canadian Muslims have not been able to access financial products that comply with their faith,” said Mohamad Sawwaf, Manzil’s CEO and co-founder. “In fact, this demographic has the lowest participation of homeownership and capital markets and it’s not because of their balance sheets; it’s due to a lack of products in the marketplace.”</p>

<p>To solve this problem, Manzil has created “<a href="https://manzil.ca/about/aaoifi-compliance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shariah-compliant</a>” financial products, which it said are designed to be participatory, rather than predatory. In conventional mortgages, for example, consumers enter into a loan agreement whereby they pay the lender back the money they borrowed plus interest over a defined term.</p>
<p>“Here, the lender is not purchasing the property, but is simply making money by lending you money,” the startup said. “This is called usury or <a href="https://www.azzadfunds.com/understanding-riba-in-islamic-finance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">riba</a> in Islam and it is not permissible and heavily frowned upon by the Muslim community at large. Islam teaches that risk has to be shared and that money cannot be made on money.”</p>
<p>Manzil’s financial products and services are built on the principle of sharing the risk equitably among the parties, not charging interest, and not investing in industries deemed “sinful” such as alcohol, gambling, and weapons.</p>
<p>In addition to home financing, Manzil also offers a mortgage income fund that is used to invest in halal mortgages and share the profits from financing payments with its investors. Although products are designed for the Muslim market, Manzil’s products are available to all consumers in Canada.</p>

<p>“The Canadian Islamic finance scene has experienced growing interest from domestic and international investors,” said Peter-Paul Van Hoeken, founder and CEO of FrontFundr. “We are delighted to have Manzil on FrontFundr, providing all Canadians the opportunity to invest in a fast-growing private company dedicated to delivering innovative Islamic finance products.”</p>
<p>FrontFundr’s platform allows investors to commit funds to early-stage and growing private companies. Earlier this year, the company received <a href="https://betakit.com/frontfundr-approved-to-bring-crowdfunding-platform-to-ontario/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approval</a> from the Ontario Securities Commission to make its services available to investors and companies in Ontario. To date, the company has helped more than 43 companies raise over $35 million.</p>
<p>In 2017, Wealthsimple <a href="https://betakit.com/wealthsimple-launches-new-portfolio-to-help-muslims-invest-according-to-islamic-principles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched</a> its own halal investment portfolio intended to help Muslims invest in accordance with religious principles. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lumeca.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lumeca Health</a>, a Regina-based healthtech startup, has partnered with telecommunications company <a href="https://www.sasktel.com/store/browse/Personal/_/N-26v0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SaskTel</a> to make virtual healthcare more accessible for residents of Cowessess First Nation.</p>
<p>The two organizations came up with a solution that allowed residents to download and use the Lumeca app in the rural community by connecting to the community office’s Smart Wi-Fi, which is powered by SaskTel.</p>
<blockquote><p>The startup received approval from the province to provide its virtual healthcare service in late March.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Lumeca continues to develop our platform to meet the needs of patients and doctors, especially with the new social distancing norm among us,” said Shawn Hazen, founder of Lumeca. “We continue to innovate and are now developing new ways for patients to see their own family doctors, and for family physicians to reach their patients as continuity of care is vital to healthcare outcomes.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Lumeca offers integrated healthcare services that connect users to doctors, specialists, and mental health professionals. The startup received <a href="https://betakit.com/lumeca-approved-to-operate-as-virtual-healthcare-services-provider-in-saskatchewan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approval</a> from the Government of Saskatchewan to provide virtual healthcare services and COVID-19 screening to the province’s residents in late March.</p>
<p>The startup’s technology gives patients direct access to licenced Saskatchewan doctors through secure text, audio, and video consultations. Doctors on the platform provide advice, diagnoses, and prescriptions for a wide range of conditions. Lumeca’s service is also available for COVID-19 screening and general health consultations.</p>

<p>According to a 2018 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6055798/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>, there are many barriers to accessing healthcare services for Indigenous people in Canada, particularly for remote Indigenous communities. Geographic isolation can add to the challenge of accessing medical care or health advice.</p>
<p>“It’s important our community members have the support and resources to take care of their health when they need it,” said Chief of Cowessess First Nation Cadmus Delorme. “Being able to access a doctor immediately for treatable conditions, from the comfort of our homes on reserve will really impact the quality of life for the Cowessess people as well better exercise our Treaty Right to Health.”</p>
<p>Lumeca is available to all Saskatchewan residents with a valid Saskatchewan Health Card for COVID-19 screening and general health consultations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>McRock Capital, which invests exclusively in the Internet of Things (IoT) companies, has held the final close for its McRock Fund II LP, reaching $112 million. With the close, the venture fund surpassed its target of $100 million.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Now more than ever, accelerating automation and digital transformation&#8230;is critical.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Fund II received new commitments from Aspen Technology, a provider of software and services for process industries, and the Fonds de solidarité FTQ, the development capital fund based on Quebec. McRock added $32 million in new capital for the final close, after raising <a href="https://betakit.com/mcrock-capital-announces-initial-close-of-80-million-for-fund-ii/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$80 million</a> last year.</p>
<p>McRock held the initial close of its second venture capital fund in September. LPs included return investor Cisco Investments, Shell, and other corporate and institutional investors that have previously backed McRock including BDC Capital, Export Development Canada, Alberta Enterprise Corporation, and HarbourVest. According to McRock, Fund II also saw participation from Caterpillar Ventures, Mitsubishi Corporation, Teralys Capital, Kensington Capital Partners, and a large, undisclosed pension fund.</p>
<p>Toronto-based McRock was co-founded by Whitney Rockley and Scott MacDonald in 2012. It invests exclusively in IoT companies in Canada, the US, and Europe. In 2015, McRock closed its first fund, with more than <a href="https://betakit.com/mcrock-raises-65-million-in-new-fund-to-invest-in-industrial-iot/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$65 million</a>, after an <a href="https://betakit.com/mcrock-capital-announces-initial-closing-of-new-50-million-fund/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initial close</a> of $50 million in 2013. “We have entered an era of profound transformation with the Industrial Internet. McRock is well positioned to unlock tremendous value in these billion dollar markets,” Rockley stated at the time.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, accelerating automation and digital transformation in industrial sectors is critical to maintaining and optimizing production,” said Rockley of the recent final close. “By adding a world leader in asset optimization through AspenTech and a highly reputable financial institution through the Fonds de solidarité FTQ, we continue to enhance our powerhouse of toptier investors in McRock.”</p>
<p>The thesis for Fund II will continue to see investments made in high-growth companies that “are combining next generation data analytics through artificial intelligence (AI) with the growing data from field devices, machines, and equipment in industrial and urban environments.”</p>
<p>McRock&#8217;s portfolio currently includes <a href="https://betakit.com/miovision-raises-120-million-cad-round-led-by-telus-ventures/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Miovision</a>, <a href="https://betakit.com/praemo-raises-3-5-million-to-develop-industrial-iot-platform/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Praemo</a>, <a href="https://betakit.com/ai-and-iot-startup-mnubo-acquired-by-aspen-technology-for-102-million-cad/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mnubo</a>, <a href="https://betakit.com/invixium-raises-4-5-million-cad-in-in-debt-financing-for-biometric-security-solution/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invixium</a>, and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate change and social impact investing have been on the mind of Real Ventures’ Sylvain Carle for some time now. A few years ago, it was mentioned to Carle that a number of Real’s investments were likely impact-related without the firm focusing on it explicitly.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Sylvain has made such an incredible contribution to the Canadian tech and startup ecosystem.&#8221;<br />
<em> &#8211; Janet Bannister, Real Ventures</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The idea stuck with Carle as Real raised its pre-seed fund in 2017, and when the firm started talking about raising a new fund last year the thought re-surfaced.</p>
<p>“This has been brewing for us for a while but I wanted more than where the rest of my partners at Real were at, especially for the planet,” Carle told BetaKit. “I have been advocating for this for a long time and I wanted this to be part of the core businesses … my partners were open, [but] it was more of an urgency for me.”</p>
<p>Because of his passion, Carle decided to step down from his role as venture partner at Real to pursue new opportunities in the climate change and impact space. Carle, who had been with Real for more than six years in a variety of roles, publicly <a href="http://www.afroginthevalley.com/2020/05/ikigai/?fbclid=IwAR1wl0sEHz8azKXd9KxKPpbtqZaL4Alu1GTJxTOwZ8tSAn1ciBBrt7X1_po" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> the move at the end of May.</p>
<p>BetaKit spoke with Carle recently about his decision and what might be next for the entrepreneur turned investor.</p>
<p>Carle shared the news in a blog post, stating he is “starting a new journey” and pursuing “the next chapter” in his life. He is set to continue to work with Real over the next six months as he transitions out of his position.</p>
<p>The venture partner has long played a significant role in the Montreal and broader Quebec tech scene. He started out with Real as a mentor for its accelerator, FounderFuel, in 2011. The venture partner had previously co-founded and been CTO of Needium, a Montreal based startup focused on monitoring social media platforms. Carle also had entrepreneurial experience at a number of different companies, including co-founding Messagia, Interstructure, and Praized. He also worked as a senior developer advocate at Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/janet-bannister-named-managing-partner-of-real-ventures/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Janet Bannister named managing partner of Real Ventures</a></strong></p>
<p>In 2014, Carle became general manager of FounderFuel, helping a number of early-stage startups raise seed capital. At the same time, he also became a partner at Real. Notable FounderFuel graduates include Sonder, Mejuri, and Bus.com. During his time at Real, Carle invested in a number of startups, the likes of which include Delve Labs, Keatext, Plotly, Unito, Vention, and more.</p>
<p>Calling Montreal-based tech hub Notman House his “house” in his blog, Carle worked closely with Real’s portfolio companies over the years. An “All-Star Mentor” at Techstars, an active board member for a number of organizations including Startupfest and previously OSMO, Carle told BetaKit he will continue to work with some of the entrepreneurs and founders he has been backing over the last few years as he slowly transitions out of his role at Real.</p>

<p>“Sylvain has made such an incredible contribution to the Canadian tech and startup ecosystem in the six years since he joined Real and we feel so privileged to have had him on our team,” Real managing partner Janet Bannister told BetaKit. </p>
<p>“We, at Real, have all learned so much from him and benefited greatly from his generosity and collaborative mindset,” she added. “We are also excited to continue to collaborate with him in the future, as he dedicates his time and energy to supporting and building solutions for climate change.</p>
<p>“For me, it was really a question of clearing some space to start some conversation,” Carle stated in regards to his decision. He explained to BetaKit he had been considering the move for some time and with Real looking to raise its next fund, it felt like the right time to make a transition.</p>
<p>“These sort of like moments of these forks in the road … you have to take them when you see a fork,” he added. “They come up every three to four years. So it was, ‘do I take it now, or do I wait a little bit longer,’ essentially.”</p>
<p>While Carle told BetaKit he is not sure what his next move will be just yet, he has had conversations with a number of organizations and leaders in the climate change and social impact space.</p>

<p>“What I want to do in my next chapter, for the next decade at least, has to be related to our current climate crisis,” he wrote in his blog post. “It’s the emergency of our century. I don’t exactly know how I will contribute to this climate challenge but I know for sure: I will dedicate my energy and my brainpower towards finding and financing innovations for mitigation, adaptation and resilience.”</p>
<p>COVID-19, Carle said, was not a direct impetus for deciding to leave Real, but worked to highlight just how important his focus on climate and social impact could be. “[The pandemic] made it even more clear”, he said. “I think there&#8217;s also a pretty unique moment, and multiply that by COVID, and [that has] got me pretty excited.”</p>
<p>Over the next six months, Carle will continue to invest as part of the four Real funds that he is already participating in. He told BetaKit, Real plans to find a replacement investment partner for its next fund “in due time.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2007, Real has invested in over 280 companies across five funds and currently has $330 million under management. The firm recently <a href="https://betakit.com/janet-bannister-named-managing-partner-of-real-ventures/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">named</a> Bannister as its managing partner and also <a href="https://betakit.com/hamzah-nassif-joins-real-ventures-as-second-partner-in-toronto/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brought on </a>Hamzah Nassif as the venture capital firm’s second partner based in Toronto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.blackcart.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlackCart</a>, a Toronto-based fashion and e-commerce startup, is coming out of beta with $2.8 million CAD ($2 million USD) in new seed funding. The funding brings the startups total raised to date to $3 million CAD. </p>
<blockquote><p>“BlackCart is bringing much-needed innovation to one of the few retail categories where brick-and-mortar shops still offer a superior experience.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The seed round was led by <a href="https://www.struckcapital.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Struck Capital</a>, with participation from <a href="https://500.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">500 Startups</a>, <a href="https://www.revelpartners.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Revel Partners</a>, and Dean Bakes, principal at <a href="https://www.m3ventures.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">M3 Ventures</a>, in addition to several unnamed angel investors and an AngelList <a href="https://angel.co/syndicates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">syndicate</a>. With this new funding, BlackCart is fast-tracking the public launch of its platform, making it available earlier than planned due to the current climate of e-commerce. The platform launched publicly on May 25.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Right now, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the whole world is forced to shop online. While this transition may be seamless for categories like electronics or homeware, for fashion, it is much more challenging,” said BlackCart co-founder and CEO Donny Ouyang. </p>
<p>“People need to touch, see, feel, and try on clothes before they make a purchase,” Ouyang added. “Stores don’t charge you for clothes before you go into a dressing room, so why should online fashion shopping be any different?”</p>
<p>According to BlackCart, 53 percent of lost fashion sales are due to uncertainty around the look or fit of a garment, and that the lack of a dressing room is the number one reason why 65 percent of shoppers prefer brick-and-mortar to online shopping.</p>

<p>BlackCart had originally planned to remain in beta for a few more months, but because the pandemic increased e-commerce, the team decided to accelerate its plans, raise capital, and get to market sooner. The move to make the platform available to the general public was intended to make a more meaningful impact on the retail landscape. </p>
<p>Notably, BlackCart claimed the entire round was raised remotely, and mostly over Zoom calls. BlackCart’s raise may be the first Canadian tech company round closed entirely remotely during the pandemic. </p>
<p>Many VCs that BetaKit has spoken with, as well as CVCA CEO Kim Furlong, have noted that recently announced rounds were in the works prior to COVID-19, and investors and the companies had already met in person before closing.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the startup told BetaKit the team had not met any of the participating investors in person prior to closing the round. In an interview with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fashion-tech-startup-raised-funding-round-entirely-over-zoom-during-covid-2020-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Business Insider</a>, Ouyang said the process took “five weeks of back and forth,” and involved “hundreds of emails” as well as about five or six meetings each day. </p>

<p>Founded in 2017, BlackCart’s solution offers a “try-before-you-buy” service for fashion e-commerce stores that integrates into a merchant’s online shopping cart. The tool is available as a plugin for WordPress and Shopify, and requires no upfront payment or hold on shoppers’ credit cards.</p>
<p>The company has also developed technology that addresses fraud detection, payments, returns, and user experience. Some of this technology allows BlackCart to assume all risk associated with damaged or unreturned items, instead of merchants taking on that risk.</p>
<p>Based on data BlackCart gathered while in beta, the company helped merchants see a 24 percent increase in conversions when the try-before-you-buy option was presented in customers’ shopping carts. The company also saw 90 percent of shoppers get approved for the try-before-you-buy features, without having a hold placed on their credit cards.</p>
<p>“BlackCart is bringing much-needed innovation to one of the few retail categories where brick-and-mortar shops still offer a superior experience to e-commerce,” said Adam Struck, founder and managing partner of Struck Capital. “We like backing founders with big visions, and Donny has a vision of transforming an entire market by providing the tools needed to simplify how customers and merchants interact.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.canadianshieldppe.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Canadian Shield</a>, a Kitchener-Waterloo-based personal protective equipment (PPE) manufacturer that was spun out of EdTech startup InkSmith, has made its face shield available to the public. The shields are available through the company’s newly-launched consumer sales <a href="https://www.canadianshieldppe.ca/pages/buy-now-the-canadian-shield" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">portal</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are currently producing double what we need to be producing to fulfill our Health Canada order.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Canadian Shield’s reusable face shields are available for delivery across Canada and can be purchased on the company’s website in quantities of two, five, and 20. The public availability launch comes as the company has fulfilled orders for Health Canada and provincial healthcare agencies, after receiving a <a href="https://www.canhealth.com/2020/04/29/contract-awarded-to-the-canadian-shield-to-produce-ppe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contract</a> in March to produce 10 million face shields by August.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As the federal and provincial governments take steps to reopen the economy, it is incredibly important that everyone has access to critical PPE,” said The Canadian Shield founder and CEO Jeremy Hedges. “By making our Canadian Shield available for consumer purchase, we hope to reduce the spread of COVID-19 while facilitating Canada’s economic recovery.”</p>
<p>Since The Canadian Shield was officially <a href="https://betakit.com/inksmith-launches-new-company-to-address-shortage-of-medical-equipment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched</a> in March by InkSmith, the team has grown from a staff of 10 to over 250. The company also opened a 50,000 square-foot facility last month, and brought in new equipment to maximize its production capabilities. InkSmith typically develops products such as 3D printers, virtual reality kits and headsets, laser cutters, and robotics kits. </p>
<p>The Canadian Shield is supplying two-thirds of the 16 million total medical face shields being procured by the federal government from Canadian companies. The Government of Canada <a href="https://betakit.com/government-expands-procurement-deals-with-canadian-startups-to-aid-with-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">committed</a> new funding, at the end of March, to procurement deals that fulfill PPE supply needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/black-swan-8-building-the-canadian-shield/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Black Swan #8 – Building the Canadian Shield</a></strong></p>
<p>“We are currently producing double what we need to be producing to fulfill our Health Canada order,”  Hedges said. “We are excited to be in a position where we can provide PPE to both frontline healthcare workers as well as consumers.”</p>
<p>Since launching its consumer sales portal, The Canadian Shield has already fulfilled over 1,000 orders. The cost of a two-pack of shields is $19.95, a five-pack is $44.95, and a 20-pack is $159.95.</p>
<p>Along with the launch of The Canadian Shield’s consumer sales portal, the company is also running a “buy one, give one” <a href="https://www.canadianshieldppe.ca/pages/buy-now-the-canadian-shield" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campaign</a>. For each reusable shield purchased online, the company will donate a shield to healthcare facilities in need, including long-term care facilities, hospitals, clinics, and other critical services that do not have sufficient access to PPE.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nesto, a startup focused on simplifying the mortgage financing experience, raised $11.5 million CAD in Series A financing.</p>
<p>The equity round was led by Investissement Québec and Diagram Ventures, a venture co-creation firm, which helped found Nesto. A group of undisclosed, “highly strategic” investors also participated in the Series A.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We intend to transform the Canadian mortgage industry.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Malik Yacoubi, Nesto</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“This new round of financing marks a turning point in nesto’s young history that will enable us to continue to deliver an outstanding experience to our clients as we invest in the evolution of our tools,” said Malik Yacoubi, Nesto’s co-founder and CEO. “We intend to transform the Canadian mortgage industry.”</p>
<p>Nesto plans to use the capital to invest in its technology, as well as its marketing and communications. A company spokesperson told BetaKit that the goal is to “let Canadians know that we are here to help them save money.”</p>
<p>The startup was launched in May 2018 by Yacoubi, Karim Benabdallah (CTO), Chase Belair (principal broker), and Damien Charbonneau (COO). Through its online platform, Nesto analyzes the mortgage market to find the best mortgage terms available. The company is authorized to pursue mortgage brokerage in Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.</p>

<p>Prior to its Series A, Nesto <a href="https://betakit.com/backed-by-diagram-mortgage-startup-nesto-latest-addition-to-power-financials-fintech-justice-league/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told BetaKit</a> it previously raised “several mini-rounds” of financing, which Yacoubi classified as “seed extension” rounds. He did not disclose the overall amount of seed funding or the specific strategic investors, but said the capital totalled “several million.”</p>
<p>Nesto is one of seven companies co-founded and backed by <a href="https://betakit.com/diagram-ventures-raises-55-million-cad-for-second-fund/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Diagram</a>. Power Financial-backed <a href="https://betakit.com/portag3-appoints-chris-oneill-as-partner-as-firm-looks-to-plant-a-flag-in-the-valley/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Portag3 Ventures</a> led Diagram’s second fund, which officially closed in June 2019.</p>
<p>BetaKit spoke with Power Financial senior vice president and Portag3 Ventures executive chairman Paul Desmarais III, last year, who introduced Nesto as the “newest member of the FinTech Justice League.” Portag3 itself has stakes in three of Canada’s most prominent FinTech startups: Koho, Wealthsimple, and Borrowell. All three specialize in financial services that frame themselves as modern alternatives to traditional banks.</p>
<p>Nesto’s approach is a mix of both challenging the incumbents and working with them. The startup partnered with life insurance provider SSQ Insurance last year and has an index of over 20 partnerships with mortgage providers across Canada, including TD and Scotiabank.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/canadas-open-banking-consultations-delayed-until-fall-at-the-earliest/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canada’s open banking consultations delayed until Fall “at the earliest”</a></strong></p>
<p>“We’re challenging them while we’re cooperating with them,” Yacoubi said to BetaKit last year of the incumbents in the mortgage industry. “Many lenders are liking the way that we are working. They want to learn more and see how we can better collaborate. We try to be as cooperative and transparent with our lender partners as we are with our customers.”</p>
<p>“We are very happy to have witnessed and believed in nesto’s potential from the get-go,” said stated Daniel Robichaud, managing partner at Diagram. “This new financial support will allow the company to speed up its growth and reach even more ambitious heights as it transforms the Canadian mortgage market.”</p>

Amid the ongoing pandemic, Nesto reported a significant increase in business volume in May, tracking its best month to date with a 729 percent increase in demand for its services compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Nesto told BetaKit that it felt the effects of COVID-19 in the first month of the pandemic, but as consumers started using more online services it saw “rapid growth.”</p>
<p>Nesto said the increase was “fueled by the context of the pandemic” due to more use and demand for virtual platforms. This comes at a time, the company said, “when the pandemic and gradual deconfinement encourage Canadians to turn to technology for their mortgage-related needs.”</p>
<p>“There is no doubt that a service such as nesto makes perfect sense at a time when a pandemic significantly limits people’s ability to get around,” said Yacoubi. “We provide sustained and personalized support to our clients and, thanks to technology, we can offer them better mortgage rates as well as all the information they need based on their situation.”</p>
<p>According to the company, its mortgage rates are the lowest in the market as a result of its “unique model” that reduces commissions to a minimum.</p>
<p>Along with its Series A funding, Nesto also grew its team, bringing on a vice president of lender relations and a senior director of operations. Marie-Elaine Gaudreault is joining to build lender partnerships and was formerly the vice president of mortgage loans at Industrial Alliance. Greg Perowne, formerly of Goodfood and Uber, is taking on the operations role.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The federal government has announced the members of its <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2020/05/minister-bains-announces-new-industry-strategy-council.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Industry Strategy Council</a>, the initiative aimed to help with Canada’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>The council, which was <a href="https://betakit.com/new-federal-council-to-seek-input-from-industrial-sectors-on-challenges-created-by-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first announced</a> in May, will act as an advisory board to assess the pandemic’s impact on industries and broaden the government’s understanding of specific sectoral pressures. The council is composed of senior business leaders who will communicate with the government as it assesses economic policy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mona Nemer, Canada’s chief scientific advisor, is joining the council to provide a science and research perspective.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Ministers and departments across government will be engaged as we work with the Industry Strategy Council to continue our whole-of-government approach to confronting COVID-19,” said Minister of Innovation, Science, and Industry Navdeep Bains. “I look forward to working hand in hand with businesses toward a recovery that makes Canadian industry more prosperous, equitable, and dynamic than ever.”</p>
<p>The members are tasked with sharing challenges faced by different sectors across Canada’s economy during the pandemic. Each member represents a different economic sector: advanced manufacturing, health and biosciences, agri-food, cleantech, digital industries, tourism, transportation, retail, or resources. The new members include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Digital industries: John Baker, president and CEO of <a href="https://www.d2l.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Desire2Learn</a></li>
<li>Health and biosciences: Karimah Es Sabar, CEO and partner at <a href="https://www.quarkventure.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quark Venture</a></li>
<li>Clean technology: Karen Hamberg, vice president of external affairs and sustainability at <a href="https://wfsinc.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Westport Fuel Systems</a></li>
<li>Retail: Paviter Binning, president of <a href="https://www.wittington-investments.co.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wittington Investments</a></li>
<li>Advanced manufacturing: Rhonda Barnet, president and COO of <a href="http://www.avitmfg.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AVIT Manufacturing</a></li>
<li>Tourism and hospitality: Ben Cowan-Dewar, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.cabotlinks.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cabot Links</a></li>
<li>Agri-food: Murad Al-Katib, president and CEO of <a href="http://www.agtfoods.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AGT Food and Ingredients</a></li>
<li>Resources: Mark Little, president and CEO <a href="https://www.suncor.com/en-ca" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Suncor Energy</a></li>
<li>Transportation: Sylvie Vachon, president and CEO of <a href="https://www.port-montreal.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Montreal Port Authority</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The council is expected to build on the federal government’s existing model for collaboration between industry and government, known as the Economic Strategy Tables, which was first used in 2017. </p>

<p>Monique Leroux, former president of Desjardins, will chair the council. The government has announced that Mona Nemer, Canada’s chief scientific advisor, is also joining as an ex-officio member to provide a perspective on science and research. An ex-officio member describes a position someone automatically gains because of another role that person already holds.</p>
<p>“It is both a great honour and a tremendous responsibility to be asked to chair the council, and I look forward to working with all members to build a starting point for Canada’s economic recovery in this new global context,” said Leroux. “The council will be a partnership between the private sector and the Government of Canada to help gain an understanding of industry challenges.”</p>
<p>Additional members of the council are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Front Row Ventures is making its pre-accelerator program, the Women Founders Project, virtual after pausing the program earlier this year due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The program is a six-week accelerator focused on female-identifying students, geared toward giving them the fundamental knowledge needed to create a startup. Originally, Front Row Ventures kicked-off the second cohort of the Women Founders Project in March but decided to &#8220;pause&#8221; the program for a couple of months due to the global pandemic.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In times like these, we recognize the importance of connecting students with individuals in the Canadian startup ecosystem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Women Founders Project has now relaunched and is offering new programming and workshops virtually. The pre-accelerator has also doubled in size from last year&#8217;s cohort and includes 16 aspiring entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>&#8220;By hosting the first remote WFP [Women Founders Project] this summer, our goal is to deliver on our commitment to support, mentor, and create value for aspiring young entrepreneurs in Canada,&#8221; the group said. &#8220;Especially in times like these, we recognize the importance of connecting students with individuals in the Canadian startup ecosystem and giving them the opportunity to build long-lasting networks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Front Row Ventures initially <a href="https://betakit.com/front-row-ventures-initiative-for-female-student-founders-expands-to-ontario/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">piloted</a> the Women Founders Project last year, with its first cohort taking place in Montreal with a class of 10 women in May 2019. Following the successful pilot, the university student-run venture capital fund decided to open up the program to include students from Ontario as well.</p>
<p>Front Row Ventures is a university student-run fund focused on investing in early-stage, student-led Canadian startups. The fund received $600,000 in October 2017 from Real Ventures to invest in 24 student-led startups over the next four years. The fund opened up to <a href="https://betakit.com/student-led-front-row-ventures-launching-in-ontario/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ontario startups</a> in March 2019.</p>
<p>When Front Row Ventures originally announced plans to expand outside of Quebec it was looking to raise $10 million from limited partners. The fund indicated it would hit at least $5 million of that within a few weeks in July 2018. Last March, Front Row Ventures told BetaKit it had yet to secure the capital and was expecting between $5 to $10 million in funding before the end of summer 2019. </p>
<p>BetaKit has reached out to Front Row Ventures to confirm if it closed any additional capital. The fund told BetaKit, &#8220;due to confidentiality responsibilities towards our LPs, we can&#8217;t disclose publicly any information about our new funds at this time.&#8221;</p>

		<title>Lack of VC activity caused by pandemic not reflected in Q1 2020, says CVCA’s Kim Furlong</title>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (CVCA) has released its detailed report for the first quarter of 2020. The report expands on the preliminary results released last month that found venture capital (VC) investment in the quarter almost on par when compared year-over-year.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I actually think the conversation we’ll be having is in Q2, and that conversation will be one that truly reflects the lack of activity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>VC investment in Canada for the first quarter of 2020 was down seven percent compared to the first quarter last year. The CVCA’s detailed report found $831 million was invested over 117 deals, compared to $897 million in 116 deals in Q1 2019.</p>
<p>Speaking with Kim Furlong, the CEO of the CVCA told BetaKit she does not see the Q1 2020 results reflecting the effect COVID-19 had on the Canadian investment landscape.</p>
<p>“I actually think the conversation we&#8217;ll be having is in Q2, and that conversation will be one that truly reflects the lack of activity that we saw in the past 12 weeks, where people were returning their attention to their current holdings, their portfolio, speaking to their CEOs, founders, and management teams, and understanding the path ahead in terms of crisis management and the inability to go and meet people,” she said.</p>
<p>While the first quarter results are only seven percent down year-over-year, they represent a 45 percent decline compared to the previous quarter. Comparatively, the fourth quarter of 2019 saw $1.6 billion invested over 144 deals and significantly contributed to the year’s record-breaking total.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-vcs-launch-initiative-to-provide-one-on-one-support-to-startups-during-pandemic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canadian VCs launch initiative to provide one-on-one support to startups during pandemic</a></strong></p>
<p>Furlong noted that it is not uncommon for the first quarter to be smaller than a previous fourth quarter. The CEO explained that a typical first quarter is always dependent on what occurs in the fourth quarter of the previous year. She said the numbers from Q4 2019 show that companies finalized deals at the end of last year instead of waiting until the beginning of 2020.</p>
<p>According to CVCA’s data, the first quarter of each year tends to be down compared to its respective fourth quarter. For example from Q4 2018 to Q1 2019 there was a 25 percent decrease in the amount of VC invested. There was a similar 37 percent drop between Q4 2018 and the first quarter of 2018. Notably, however, Q4 2019 to Q1 2020 is the most pronounced decline the CVCA has reported in the last five years</p>
<p>With Q1 2020 ending March 31, Furlong said the CVCA has been tracking Canadian VC deal flow slowing down significantly because of COVID-19 and, specifically, the social distancing rules that were implemented.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re still seeing some activity,” she noted. “But that, I believe, is in large part conversation that had originally been initiated [prior to social distancing], or sectors that are so specific to the current need.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re still seeing some activity. But that, I believe, is in large part conversation that had originally been initiated.&#8221;<br />
<em> &#8211; Kim Furlong, CVCA</em><br />
&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of startups that BetaKit has recently spoken to that have raised recent rounds have confirmed this is the case. Most CEOs that have spoken to BetaKit acknowledged their round had been in the works prior to the pandemic and closed following social distancing measures.</p>
<p>The average deal size for the first quarter of 2020 was $7.1 million, a 14 percent year-over-year decrease from last year and three percent lower than the average deal size during the five-year period between 2015 to 2019.</p>
<p>There were three $50 million plus mega deals in Q1 2020, which accounted for 31 percent of the total dollars invested. The largest of those deals was Miovision Technologies’ $120 million CAD Series C.</p>
<p>Almost two-thirds of deal flow was less than $5 million, with 19 deals between $5 million and $20 million. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) companies received 54 percent dollars invested while life sciences companies received 21 percent. Early stage companies received 50 percent of the funding, for a total of $419 million in 72 deals.</p>
<p>One striking fact CVCA reported was that the pace of VC-backed exits slowed with only three disclosed merger and acquisition exits in Q1 2020. Comparatively, each quarter was averaging 10 exits, according to the report, in the five-year period between 2015 to 2019.</p>
<p>Ontario continued to lead in the amount of capital invested, with $504 million in 34 deals. Quebec recorded 35 deals, but with $99 million. British Columbia tracked $164 million in 21 deals, with $53 million in 11 deals for Alberta.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/bdc-capital-reveals-more-details-on-investment-matching-program-for-vc-backed-companies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BDC Capital reveals more details on investment matching program for VC-backed companies</a></strong></p>
<p>Venture debt investment for Q1 2020 totalled $75 million spanning 15 deals. The majority of venture debt dollars went to British Columbia-based companies, with $36 million overall.</p>
<p>Private equity, on the other hand, was more than twice the amount compared to the same quarter last year. In Q1 2020, $4.7 billion in private equity was invested in Canadian companies compared to $2.1 billion in Q1 2019.</p>
<p>CVCA reported that compared to the four-year average of activities in first quarters between 2016 to 2019, the pacing of private equity deal flow in the first quarter of 2020 remained consistent, but the dollars invested was nine percent lower overall.</p>
<p>“Private equity investment is off to a great start in 2020 however, having only captured data until<br />
March, the results do not reflect the implications of COVID-19,” said Furlong. “That being said, many have suggested that privately held companies may have an advantage to their publicly traded equivalent; the support of a PE partner may bring additional liquidity, operational and network support and expertise to minimize the impact of COVID-19.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shopify has resurfaced long-standing criticisms of its company policies after CEO Tobi Lütke shared a message of support for Black communities amid the ongoing protests against racial injustice in the United States.</p>
<p>On Monday, Lütke shared, via Twitter, an internal message he had sent to Shopify employees, lamenting “the sheer injustice” of what is occurring in the US.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We understand that the problem of racism will not be solved by one action, but we believe that our actions today&#8230;is a good step forward.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Shopify co-founder also promised donations from Shopify of $500,000 to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, an American legal firm fighting for racial justice; $250,000 to Black Health Alliance a charity working to improve the health of Black people in Canada; and $250,000 to Campaign Zero, which performs research and analysis of policing practices in the US.</p>
<p>“These events show us how imperfect the world is,” Lütke wrote. “No matter the arc of history as it’s taking, there is so much work to be done yet. These things absolutely do not have any space in a company like Shopify. This entire company is a company built around helping people to improve their lot. The equality of opportunity is fundamental to the way we think.”</p>
<p>While many applauded the move, others took to Twitter urging Shopify to ban what they called “white supremacist” organizations that currently use the platform for their online stores.</p>
<p>“[Shopify is] a site that consistently funds white supremacist sites by powering their storefronts,” <a href="https://twitter.com/johnath/status/1267556509413670924" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Raw Signal Group co-founder (and occasional BetaKit contributor) Johnathan Nightingale. “It&#8217;s great that you&#8217;re giving money to black justice organizations but could you maybe stop bankrolling the white supremacists while you&#8217;re at it.” </p>
<p>Jeremy Keith, co-founder of Clearleft, called the statement “hypocrisy.” “That’s some cognitive dissonance when you’re enabling white supremacists while sending company-wide memos about injustice,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/adactio/status/1267813001433939968" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> via Twitter.</p>
<p>Another Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/Ameemabackwards/status/1267598909335130117" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chimed in</a>, “while financial compensation is great &#8211; it tends to feel hollow when you’re actively allowing White supremacists to profit.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m not a politician, activist, or frontline worker. My day &amp; night is spent thinking about economic opportunity. In that arena, you have my commitment that I and Shopify will do everything we can to push economic opportunities to black entrepreneurs.</p>

<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The criticisms against Shopify are not new, <a href="https://betakit.com/ceo-tobi-lutke-responds-to-petition-asking-shopify-to-stop-powering-breitbart-store/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">originally</a> surfacing in early 2017. The focus at the time was on Shopify hosting the online store of far-right publication Breitbart, which is known for its popularity amongst white nationalists. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-receives-petition-with-200000-signatures-to-drop-breitbart/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">petition</a> featuring more than 200,000 signatures was delivered to the company, calling for Shopify to stop hosting Breitbart’s merchandise. The company also faced internal pressure regarding the decision, with employees penning a letter to Lütke claiming he had been “dismissive” of their concerns.</p>
<p>Lütke, at the time, released a statement noting that Shopify did not advertise on the site or endorse the views of Breitbart. He said, however, “products are a form of speech, and free speech must be fiercely protected, even if we disagree with some of the voices.” </p>
<p>“We don’t like Breitbart, but products are speech and we are pro free speech,” the CEO added. “This means protecting the right of organizations to use our platform even if they are unpopular, or if we disagree with their premise, as long as they are within the law.”</p>
<p>In response to sustained criticism, Shopify <a href="https://www.obj.ca/techopia-ottawa-shopify-bans-hate-groups" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">updated</a> its policy standards in 2018, banning groups that promote hate or violence from using its platform. The e-commerce giant called the move “[a] proactive measure on our part to ensure we keep our platform free of anyone seeking to promote hate or violence.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-05/shopify-bans-some-right-wing-groups-after-activist-pressure" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> reports at the time, the Proud Boys, founded by VICE Media co-founder Gavin McInnes and designated by the Southern Poverty Law Centre in the US as a hate group, were affected by the change and banned.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shopify funds some good things &amp; there are people working there who I count as friends. They also host Breitbart.</p>
<p>In tech, we are *awful* at talking about this colossal dissonance. Tiptoeing around it does the people protesting for their lives in the streets a huge disservice.</p>
<p>&mdash; Chris Adams (@mrchrisadams) <a href="https://twitter.com/mrchrisadams/status/1267758132517916675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Breitbart, however, was one organization that was not affected by Shopify’s policy change. In response to Lütke’s statement on Monday, Twitter users, including Raw Signal Group co-founder Melissa Nightingale (and also an occasional BetaKit contributor), pointed out that Breitbart’s online store is still powered by Shopify.</p>
<p>“People in Canadian tech sometimes ask if Shopify is still doing the whole Breitbart thing,” Ms. Nightingale wrote. “For some reason, many folks feel like they aren&#8217;t. Let&#8217;s be clear tho [sic]&#8230;they are.”</p>
<p>Colin Coller, VP of architecture at Vena Solutions and former CTO of Uberflip, <a href="https://twitter.com/colincoller/status/1267534554224566275" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed</a> online that he was pleased to see Lütke and Shopify’s gesture, stating, “I believe it&#8217;s heartfelt, but I&#8217;m having trouble squaring this with the Breitbart Store still having ‘Powered by Shopify’ at the bottom.”</p>
<p>Ms. Nightingale also pointed to other online stores that some have <a href="https://twitter.com/eakinsey/status/1267549969042427904" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called out</a> for having a “heinous line of goods” for attempting to undermine the importance of the Black Lives Matter movement. The store, Piper Lou, had been advertising shirts that read “Drunk Wives Matter.” The merchandise appears to have been since taken down.</p>

<p>In response to questions about whether Shopify plans to ban groups like Breitbart from using its platform, the company told BetaKit it does not comment on individual merchants. A Shopify spokesperson pointed BetaKit to its Acceptable Use Policy, which describes activities that are not permitted on the Shopify platform.</p>
<p>Under the policy, Shopify prohibits a number of activities spanning copyright infringement, child exploitation, and illegal activities. Shopify also prohibits harassment, bullying, defamation and threats; terrorist organizations; and hateful content including the promotion of hate or violence “based on race, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, medical condition, veteran status or other forms of discriminatory intolerance.” </p>
<p>Shopify notes that its services cannot be used to “promote or support organizations, platforms or people that: (i) promote or condone such hate; or (ii) threaten or condone violence to further a cause.”</p>
<p>“Shopify’s mission is to make commerce better for everyone,” the Shopify spokesperson told BetaKit. “We exist to ensure more voices can be heard through entrepreneurship. We understand that the problem of racism will not be solved by one action, but we believe that our actions today along with continuing to have conversations with communities who are directly affected by racism, is a good step forward.”</p>
<p>When reached for comment, the Nightingales referred BetaKit to their public statements on Twitter.</p>
<p>Shopify is not the only major tech company facing backlash amidst the ongoing protests against racial inequality and injustice occurring in both Canada and the US.</p>
<p>On Monday, Facebook employees held a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/01/facebook-workers-rebel-mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">virtual walkou</a>t over the company’s refusal to remove posted statements made by Donald Trump that called for violence against protestors. Twitter responded by <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-39-metro-morning/clip/15779141-trump-in-turf-war-with-one-of-his-most-powerful-tools-twitter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hiding a similar message</a> behind a warning label.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Poka, a Quebec City-based startup that has developed a “connected workforce” app, has closed $6.4 million CAD.</p>
<p>The round was led by SE Ventures, the venture capital arm of Schneider Electric, and included participation from existing investors, which were not disclosed. Previous investors in Poka have included Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH, the Leclerc family, and original seed investors Inovia Capital and Uncork Capital.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The pandemic has exposed&#8230;the shortcomings of the traditional approaches&#8230;in factories.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Poka plans to use the funding to “broaden” its global market reach through new distribution strategies. The startup also plans to accelerate product development in order to support Poka’s vision to give manufacturers one single hub for “operational knowledge and collaboration” on the factory floor.</p>
<p>Poka was founded in 2014 by CEO Alex Leclerc and CTO Antoine Bisson. It developed what it calls a connected worker platform, made specifically for manufacturers. The company looks to provide “a hub” for operational knowledge in factories by way of helping workers learn, share, and collaborate.</p>

Prior to its most recent round, Poka raised $17 million, including a <a href="https://betakit.com/poka-raises-10-million-to-be-the-messaging-platform-for-factories/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$10 million</a> round in 2018. This latest financing brings its total funding to date to $23.4 million.</p>
<p>Notably, Poka’s most recent financing round is smaller in size than the raise from 2018. While it is not typical to see a company raise a smaller VC round than its previous raises, several VCs BetaKit spoke with on background explained it is not entirely unusual.</p>
<p>Poka called the $6.4 million an “expansion round or top up round.” A spokesperson for the company told BetaKit, “basically this was a strategic round that enabled us to bring in an important investor now without waiting until the next Series.”</p>
<p>While VCs that BetaKit spoke with were not familiar with the term “expansion round,” they explained that raising a smaller round compared to previous ones can occur when a company is looking for extension or bridge financing. They told BetaKit, on background, that COVID-19 has led to companies offering these types of rounds at the same valuation as previous investments and called it a way to keep startups from having to lay off employees or go under.</p>

<p>Amid COVID-19, Poka, like many businesses has been forced to adapt its work from home policies and all of its implementations are now being done remotely in order to keep employees and customers safe. The startup said the pandemic has also served to “raise the importance of digitally connecting frontline workers in light of physical distancing and work from home measures.”</p>
<p>“The pandemic has exposed/highlighted [sic] the shortcomings of the traditional approaches to training, communication and problem solving in factories and as a result, increased the urgency for manufacturers to move to Poka,” the Poka spokesperson told BetaKit. “Our clients have reported (starting as early as January) how Poka is helping them to keep workers safe by giving alternatives to in-person shift changeover meetings, training in classrooms and paper forms and reports.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vention, a manufacturing automation tech startup, has raised $38 million CAD in Series B financing.</p>
<p>The round was led by Georgian Partners and included participation from return investors Bain Capital Ventures and White Star Capital. The financing will be used to further develop Vention&#8217;s cloud-based platform, grow its &#8220;library of plug-and-play automation components,&#8221; and continue with international expansion.</p>
<blockquote><p>The digital platform allows manufacturers to automate their production floors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Vention was founded in 2016 by CEO Etienne Lacroix. The Montreal-based startup is on a mission to &#8220;democratize industrial automation.&#8221; It touts itself as a pioneer in &#8220;a new era of manufacturing technologies where ease of use and speed meet industrial automation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The digital platform allows manufacturers to automate their production floors by helping them design, program, order, and commission automated equipment directly from their web browsers. According to Vention, its platform is currently used in over 1,000 factories across three continents.</p>
<p>The Series B round follows just over a year after Vention raised <a href="https://betakit.com/montreals-vention-closes-17-million-series-a-adds-ai-to-custom-manufacturing-platform/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$17 million CAD</a> in Series A financing. To date, the startup has raised <a href="https://betakit.com/with-3-5-million-seed-round-vention-launches-platform-that-automates-industrial-design/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than</a> $58 million.</p>
<p>Vention is set to release what it called &#8220;significant changes&#8221; to its automation platform this year. The company stated plans to augement both software and hardware capabilities. Georgian Partners&#8217; Impact team, which includes tech experts and Ph.D.’s with expertise in areas including deep learning, software engineering, natural language processing and privacy, is set to work with Vention&#8217;s tech team. The goal of the partnership is to further expand Vention&#8217;s use of artificial intelligence and machine learning for use in machine design and digital supply chains.</p>

<p>Vention is the latest in a string of manufacturing-focused Canadian startups that have received a financial boost amid COVID-19. Earlier this week, Waterloo&#8217;s <a href="https://betakit.com/clearpath-robotics-raises-40-million-cad-series-c-for-industrial-robot-division/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clearpath Robotics</a> raised $40 million CAD in Series C funding and Quebec-based Poka, which has created a connected worker platform specifically for manufacturers, raised its own financing.</p>
<p>The pandemic is having an interesting effect on startups operating in the manufacturing space. Clearpath CEO Matt Rendall told BetaKit that while COVID-19 has producers accelerating their automation strategies, health and safety regulations restrict third-parties from enteringn the plants to make installations.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-montreal-startup-vention-raises-38-million-in-venture-capital/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Globe and Mail</a>, Vention CEO Lacroix said the pandemic will slow the company&#8217;s expansion of its sales, which had reportedly increased by almost 400 percent last year. Lacroix said he still expects Vention&#8217;s revenues to double despite the slow down caused by COVID-19.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I’m not supposed to be here.</em></p>
<p>I know. We’re all thinking that, and it’s true for everyone. But I was literally supposed to be somewhere else this month. In another province &#8211; one that has never seemed further away.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Instead of crying, I started laughing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We know what we’re gaining by staying home (safely). What are we losing? And what are those organizations and communities that were built to bring you to a specific place, at a specific time, doing now?</p>
<p>Uniting the Prairies is an annual tech conference connecting the Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan tech communities. For a region often considered “flyover country” by the major Canadian tech hubs, that’s a big deal. </p>
<p>UP 2020 was to be the event’s second year, and feature speakers from Microsoft, Shopify, Google, and BetaKit, as well as a ton of local founders and startups. Jordan Dutchak, founder of the conference and executive director of Co.Labs, a Saskatchewan technology incubator and partner for the event, explains what it’s like to pull the plug on the event you built for your community, and how that community is getting through COVID-19.</p>
<p>Not every event is cancelled. While many of the major tech events have halted, some have pivoted to video! Collision will attempt that later in June, and so will CIX.</p>
<p>But there are still events scheduled for later in the year sitting in limbo. Like many professional sports, there’s a possibility they might return, but almost a certainty that they won’t look the same.</p>
<p>Take Elevate, Canada’s largest home-grown tech and innovation festival, which is scheduled for late September. We spoke with Lisa Zarzeczny, Elevate’s Senior Director of Operations, about what it’s like to plan for an event in an uncertain world, and how the festival has tried to re-produce its in-person experience online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, the Ontario provincial government announced temporary changes to its labour laws, a move its hopes will protect employees from permanent layoffs and businesses from potential closures.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This regulatory change will protect businesses from being forced to permanently lay off their employees due to COVID-19.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Typically, the province&#8217;s Employment Standards Act requires businesses to terminate employees who have been laid off for 13 weeks and pay them severance. The government has enacted a new regulatory amendment to the Employment Standards Act, meant to ensure that businesses are not forced to terminate employees after their temporary layoff periods have expired.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-union employees will now be considered on &#8216;Infectious Disease Emergency Leave&#8217; during COVID-19 if their work hours are temporarily reduced or eliminated by their employer because of the pandemic. Workers will remain employed and will be able to receive legal protections and still be eligible for federal emergency income support programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we take the necessary steps to safely and gradually restart the economy, we need to make sure business owners can reopen their doors and workers have jobs to go back to,&#8221; said Monte McNaughton, Ontario&#8217;s minister of labour, training, and skills development. &#8220;This regulatory change will protect businesses from being forced to permanently lay off their employees due to COVID-19 and suffer a financial loss that could shutter their operations for good.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/what-canadian-provinces-are-doing-to-support-businesses-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">What Canadian provinces are doing to support businesses amid COVID-19</a></strong></p>
<p>The amendment applies retroactively to March 1 and will expire six weeks after the declared state of emergency ends in the province.</p>
<p>According to Statistics Canada, 379,000 Ontario workers were temporarily laid off in April 2020, a year-over-year increase of 2,496 percent.</p>
<p>Ontario noted that its financial accountability office estimates about 2.2 million provincial employees were directly affected by pandemic-related shutdowns, with around half of those facing job losses and the other half seeing &#8220;sharply reduced hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>A number of Canadian startups that have made pandemic-related <a href="https://betakit.com/rangle-temporarily-lays-off-78-employees-as-financial-pressures-from-pandemic-hit-cdntech/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">layoffs</a> have made the decision to enact temporary layoffs, in the hops of rehiring those employees when things turn around. In <a href="https://betakit.com/as-sales-return-careguide-looks-to-rehire-furloughed-staff-following-covid-19-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some cases</a>, companies have been able to rehire employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s easy for founders to feel trapped when a global crisis like COVID-19 hits. Compared to the loss that others are facing, it can be difficult to focus on solving the problems related to your business, let alone focusing on scale.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tech companies across Canada and the world can make a massive positive impact.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Dr. Vipan Nikore, both a practicing medical doctor and startup founder, sees things differently. His belief is that tech companies across Canada and the world can make a massive positive impact, no matter what industry they’re in.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking with BetaKit, Dr. Nikore shared how he’s building his company in the wake of COVID-19, and shared his suggestions for how entrepreneurs can make an impact in the middle of a crisis.</p>
<h3>Fast, not lean</h3>
<p>Dr. Nikore has a lot on his plate day-to-day. He’s the founder of home care marketplace startup <a href="https://homecarehub.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Homecare Hub</a>. He’s also a practicing doctor at Trillium Health Partners and Cleveland Clinic Toronto, a part-time professor at the University of Toronto School of Medicine, and TD Bank’s Chief Medical Director. </p>
<p>This busy schedule, he said, allows him to keep on top of issues in the world. So when his fledgling team of seven at Homecare Hub learned of COVID-19, they knew it would impact the business in a few notable ways. Dr. Nikore said that, in particular, the business had to stop being lean and start being fast. </p>
<p>“We had to accelerate things,” said Dr. Nikore. “We had this grand roadmap of things that we wanted to do &#8211; and a lot of them were 6-12 months down the road, or even a year-plus down the road. Some of them we had to put the gas on right now [because] this is what the world needs right now.”</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/how-furnishr-grew-to-1-million-in-annual-revenue/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How Furnishr Grew to $1 Million in Annual Revenue</a></strong></p>
<p>Dr. Nikore’s original goal was to build Homecare Hub’s marketplace functionality, find traction, raise money, and then attack the grander features of his roadmap. COVID-19 threw a wrench in those plans, and now the company is building additional, untested features like telehealth and explicit support for retirement homes. </p>
<p>“We were going to focus on the operational side, and we’re still doing that, but we had to divert some resources into that innovation and thinking piece,” he said.</p>
<h3>Making an impact during a crisis</h3>
<p>While Homecare Hub is in the healthtech space, making it well-positioned to respond to a health crisis, Dr. Nikore believes the way the company shifted applies to every tech startup looking to make an impact during COVID-19.</p>
<h4>Change tactics, not mission</h4>
<p>“Remember why you created your company in the first place,” said Dr. Nikore. “Eventually, we’ll get back to normal.” </p>
<p>Instead of making a fundamental business change, Dr. Nikore encourages startups to look at the scope of their mission or vision, seeing how they can help customers within that scope, <a href="https://betakit.com/skipthedishes-commits-15-million-to-covid-19-relief-efforts-partners-with-food-banks-canada/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as many in Canadian tech are already doing</a>. For example, in Homecare Hub’s case, it became clear that patients who needed homecare also have trouble getting food delivered, so Homecare Hub is looking at partnerships with delivery services to ensure food access. In a non-healthcare startup, these changes could be more subtle, such as helping with remote work productivity or information management during COVID chaos. </p>
<p>“We’ve been thoughtful of what our scope is,” he said. “We’re not going to make a vaccine unless I had some magical way to make a vaccine.”</p>
<h4>Look at downstream challenges</h4>
<p>If your business is in a position to continue operating, build for the future. </p>
<p>“Think about all the people who are struggling from the economy being shut down, and all the measures that we’ve had to take in order to prevent the virus,” said Dr. Nikore. “Think about how we can help those people… the rest of the world outside of healthcare.”</p>
<p>From remote working and household management to financial and mental health, the world will be forever changed by COVID-19. Given the breadth of potential lasting effects, startups have many opportunities to build a helpful solution to a downstream problem. </p>
<h4>Change scope only for unique impact</h4>
<p>If your existing business infrastructure can help ease suffering during the crisis in a unique way, Dr. Nikore said it’s worth a temporary shift in your mission and operations scope. In the case of COVID-19, a noted shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers was <a href="https://betakit.com/inksmith-launches-new-company-to-address-shortage-of-medical-equipment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">something some Canadian tech firms have been able to pivot</a> into manufacturing.</p>
<p>“I would go out of scope to be helpful, if it’s something that we are in a unique position to do better than most people,” said Dr. Nikore. “But not simply to say ‘I’m helping.’”</p>
<h3>Now is not the time to be greedy</h3>
<p>Riding on the heels of a bullish 2018 and 2019, Canadian tech was poised for more growth in 2020. COVID-19 all but ended that opportunity. For Dr. Nikore, though, there’s a silver lining: with growth off the table for most, building for the betterment of the world becomes the only viable option.</p>
<p>“This is a pandemic &#8211; let’s not think too much about dollars and cents,” said Dr. Nikore. “Just work on doing good things for the world.”</p>

<p>While Dr. Nikore asks founders to remember their long-term visions for when the pandemic is over, in the meantime, he urges all people to come together as “citizens.”  Unimpressed by COVID profiteers, especially around PPE, Dr. Nikore said they represent a small minority of the world. </p>
<p>“The better we come together to help the world, the sooner we can all get back to work normally,” he said. “When the world is in a good place, everyone will be in a better place to succeed.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toronto-based food ordering and mobile pickup startup Ritual has reportedly raised $29.8 million CAD ($22 million USD) from existing investors. </p>
<p>The startup raised the capital quietly over the past couple of months, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-ritual-offers-lower-cost-service-model-to-hard-hit-restaurant-sector/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to reporting by The Globe and Mail. The publication also noted the raise is believed to come at a lower valuation than Ritual&#8217;s $90 million CAD <a href="https://betakit.com/ritual-raises-90-million-cad-series-c/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Series C round</a> led by Georgian Partners in 2018.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since April, Ritual has built a new product that launched as part of a partnership with the City of Toronto earlier this month.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ritual raised the capital after cutting its workforce <a href="https://betakit.com/ritual-cuts-staff-in-half-reduces-operations-due-to-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in half</a> in early April, as it looked to reduce operations due to the impact of COVID-19. Ritual co-founders Ray Reddy, Larry Stinson, and Robert Kim said in a public statement at the time that the startup had been heavily affected by the “devastating impact” COVID-19 was having on the restaurant industry.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the layoffs, Ritual also ceased operations in Europe due to dwindling sales. The move came mere months after Ritual <a href="https://betakit.com/ritual-expands-into-first-non-english-speaking-markets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expanded</a> into its first non-English markets, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Steve Leightell, a partner with Georgian Partners, told The Globe the financing was about more than simply funding Ritual so it could continue operations, but about innovating.</p>
<p>Since April, Ritual, which previously focused on pickup, has built a new product that launched as part of a partnership with the City of Toronto <a href="https://betakit.com/ritual-city-of-toronto-partner-to-provide-free-ordering-tool-to-local-foodservice-businesses/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier this month</a>. </p>
<p>The tool, called Ritual ONE, provides foodservice businesses, including restaurants, grocers, butchers, and bakeries with a way to accept digital orders from their own website and social media accounts, commission-free. Ritual ONE offers businesses the option for takeout or delivery, contactless ordering, and an automated loyalty program.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/facedrive-looks-to-acquire-foodora-canada-assets-as-it-launches-food-delivery-service/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facedrive looks to acquire Foodora Canada assets as it launches food delivery service</a></strong></p>
<p>For the City of Toronto partnership, Ritual provided the tool for free to businesses that signed up before June 1. Currently, Ritual is running a promotion, offering a free lifetime subscription to Ritual ONE for restaurants that sign up by June 12.</p>
<p>Ritual is promoting the new product as a &#8220;commission-free online ordering&#8221; tool. This positions Ritual against other food delivery apps, which, amid COVID-19, are facing increased scrutiny due to their commission fee practices. Restaurants from across Canada have <a href="https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/high-delivery-app-fees-frustrate-restaurant-owners-during-covid-19-pandemic-1.4945458" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that third-party delivery services like Skip the Dishes and Door Dash have caused additional financial difficulty amid the pandemic. Ritual touts its current offering as a way to minimize the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the local economy. </p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Ritual raised more than $143 million CAD prior to the pandemic. The pickup app originally launched in Toronto, followed by the United States three years later. Also prior to the pandemic, Ritual had seen a growing number of competitors in the food pickup space, from <a href="https://betakit.com/uber-eats-goes-up-against-ritual-brings-new-pickup-feature-to-toronto/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Uber Eats</a>, which began piloting its new “Pickup” service in Toronto last year, to Foodora (since <a href="https://betakit.com/foodora-to-cease-operations-in-canada-citing-highly-saturated-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exited</a> Canada), and other order-ahead apps from retailers like McDonald’s and Starbucks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sonic Incytes, a medical device startup based in Vancouver, has raised a $3.5 million CAD seed round. This startup’s funding raised to date now totals $4.5 million CAD. </p>
<p>Investors in the round included non-profit research organization Genome BC, which contributed $1 million through its Industry Innovation program. Although Genome BC provided the largest portion of capital, there was no technical lead named as part of this round. Other participants included Small World Group, Think Top Investments, and Sunhope Venture Capital, in addition to angel investors World Changing Ventures, TMFOX, UBC Seed Fund, and E-Fund.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Access to a point of care diagnostic solution that replaces biopsy and MRI is an urgent unmet need.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The new capital will be used by Sonic Incytes to commercialize its medical device that assesses and manages chronic liver disease. </p>
<p>“This financing will go a long way in helping us redefine the standard of care in quantifying fatty liver disease. Physicians will soon be able to accurately diagnose liver disease with a solution comparable to MRI,” said George Aliphtiras, CEO of Sonic Incytes. “Access to a point of care diagnostic solution that replaces biopsy and MRI is an urgent unmet need for effective patient management, and we are ideally positioned to address this emerging health crisis.”</p>
<p>Sonic Incyte has developed a portable, non-invasive, handheld solution that measures liver disease using 3D tissue sampling, similar to how a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tool operates.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/medical-innovation-xchange-partners-with-ontario-government-to-assist-companies-in-retooling-for-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Medical Innovation Xchange partners with Ontario government to assist companies in retooling for COVID-19</a></strong></p>
<p>The solution is aimed to provide an accurate, clear picture of liver health in real-time, allowing physicians to be confident in diagnosing, treating, and caring for patients. The startup said the entire procedure takes approximately five minutes in a doctor’s office. </p>
<p>Sonic Incyte was spun out of the University of British Columbia (UBC) and founded in 2017. It has received support from the Innovation UBC network, a program that turns research discoveries and partnerships into new technologies, services, treatments, and policies. After graduating from the Hatch accelerator program, the company raised $1 million, according to Innovation UBC.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to provide Sonic Incytes with $1 million in capital through our Industry Innovation Fund,” said Tony Brooks, CFO and vice president of entrepreneurship and commercialization at Genome BC. “Our investment, alongside funding from other investors, will help Sonic Incytes commercialize this innovative solution and make a significant difference in the management of liver disease and improve overall health and wellness.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tugboat Logic, which provides automated tech for the security assurance market, has raised a $10.8 million CAD ($8 million USD) funding round.</p>
<p>The round was led by Inovia Capital, with participation from Westwave Capital and several &#8220;leading industry investors&#8221; such as Tom Noonan, founder of Internet Security Systems (ISS) and partner and co-founder of investor TechOperators, as well as Terry Dolce, founder of Carbon Black.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There is a gap in the market for a new approach to help InfoSec teams scale up their impact.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Based in California, Tugboat was founded in 2017 by CEO Ray Kruck, a Canadian who currently serves as an associate for the Creative Destruction Lab programs in Calgary and Vancouver. In 2018, Tugboat opened a Canadian corporate head office in Calgary, Alberta. The move was supported by Calgary Economic Development.</p>
<p>&#8220;After researching a number of possible sites, we selected Calgary for our headquarters for several reasons,&#8221; said Kruck at the time. &#8220;When compared to other Canadian centers,  Alberta&#8217;s tech sector stood out with its large artificial intelligence research and development capacity, highly skilled and accessible engineering workforce, business-friendly climate along with tremendous support from organizations like Calgary Economic Development. One visit here and Calgary became an obvious choice for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissa Mecca, head of marketing communications for Inovia, told BetaKit recently that Tugboat has plans to grow its operations within the country.</p>
<p>Tugboat offers what it calls its Security Assurance Platform, an automated technology meant to make it easier to create and manage an InfoSec program. InfoSec refers to the practice of protecting information by mitigating risks, or performing risk management. The platform helps automate InfoSec policy creation, audit readiness, and security questionnaire responses. According to Tugboat, its tech can help enterprises prepare for audits &#8220;in half the time and at a fraction of the cost&#8221; of traditional consulting firms.</p>

<p>The startup plans to use is recent funding to help expand the automated compliance capabilities of its Security Assurance Platform, making further investments in what it calls its patent-pending AssureLogic AI engine. Tugboat also plans to build out a &#8220;robust&#8221; channel of security partners and expand its customer success infrastructure.</p>
<p>“Enterprises choose Tugboat Logic to solve a sales problem,” said Kruck. “Our customers need help knowing what they need to do to pass the security due diligence stage of the sales process. We provide them with the guidance and automation to become audit-ready quickly, and then leverage their security posture with compelling assurance tools to share with their customers.”</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Tugboat Logic to lead the Security Assurance market where we see the opportunity to bring automation and innovation to advance security operations for the enterprise,” said Shawn Abbott, partner at Inovia. “There is a gap in the market for a new approach to help InfoSec teams scale up their impact on the business with applications and services that drive topline revenue for the organization. This gap is most acute for the small to mid-enterprise market where security and compliance assurance can be most challenging to achieve.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spiderwort, an Ottawa-based healthtech and biomaterials startup, has raised a seed round of funding at $3.4 million CAD ($2.5 million USD).</p>
<p>The round was led by Horizons Ventures, and &#8220;supported by a number of groups,&#8221; the company said, including the Capital Angel Network, Break Off Capital, Anges Québec, and a United States-based syndicate.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We believe that our biomaterial has the potential to significantly change lives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The seed round follows shortly after Spiderwort announced a <a href="https://betakit.com/biomaterials-startup-spiderwort-raises-500000-friends-and-family-round/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$500,000 CAD</a> oversubscribed friends and family funding round. Spiderwort revealed the round in June. A Spiderwort spokesperson told BetaKit the seed financing &#8220;is in addition to the Friends and Family round.&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spiderwort is developing a new biomaterial that uses plant-derived cellulose to create a variety of “scaffold architectures” for regenerative medicine. It is currently in the pre-clinical stage of this product. The startup plans to use the funding to continue its work towards clinical trials, which it called &#8220;key&#8221; to bringing its biomaterial to market.</p>
<p>“We believe that our biomaterial has the potential to significantly change lives and fundamentally transform multiple industries,&#8221; said Charles M. Cuerrier, CEO of Spiderwort. &#8220;We have a lot of hard work ahead, but we are confident that the results will speak for themselves.”</p>

<p>Spiderwort pointed to conditions such as spinal cord injury repair, soft tissue replacement and reconstruction, and cell and plant-based meats and food products, as potential applications for the technology.</p>
<p>The company recently moved into a new biotechnology research facility at Collège La Cité in Ottawa and noted that the development of its management team has been supported by the Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) Health stream in Vancouver. It is also currently part of the OBIO Capital Access Advisory Program in Toronto and the IO Accelerator at Invest Ottawa. Spiderwort said it has also received funding from the Ontario Brain Institute (OBI), the OCE, and the National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC IRAP).</p>
<p>As part of the seed round, Spiderwort is adding two new members to its board of directors: Dane Bedward, chairman and former president of Genzyme Canada, and Patrick Zhang of Horizons Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trusscore, a material science company that combines sustainable materials and nanotechnology, has raised a $5.33 million CAD seed round of financing.</p>
<p>The round was led by a group of private individuals, which Dave Caputo, CEO of Trusscore, said included &#8220;serial entrepreneurs, construction executives, family and friends.”</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are committed to changing the way the world builds, reducing material waste, and leaving the world a better place.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Founded in 2007, Trusscore&#8217;s goal is to change the way &#8220;people build buildings and the environmental footprint left behind when they do.&#8221; According to the company, its Wall&#038;CeilingBoard can help change the way interior walls are built, by using a material that is installed &#8220;three times faster and is incredibly durable, reusable and recyclable.&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company is focused on the research and development (R&#038;D) of its building material, and plans to use the seed funding to assist with that as well as help scale production. The company also plans to grow the Trusscore team, which, according to LinkedIn, currently sits around 33 employees.</p>
<p>Trusscore&#8217;s marketing and R&#038;D teams are based out of the Communitech Hub in Kitchener, with manufacturing plants in Palmerston, Ontario and Dayton, Ohio.</p>
<p>“Having capital come from investors in the building materials sector is encouraging and humbling,&#8221; said Caputo. &#8220;At Trusscore, we are committed to changing the way the world builds, reducing material waste, and leaving the world a better place for the next generation.”</p>

<p>Take a look at this recent <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ontario?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ontario</a> project, which used TempWall by Trusscore — a total of 50-bed spaces, by 20 volunteers, in less than 3 hours. </p>

<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Amid COVID-19, Trusscore developed a line of antimicrobial temporary walls, called TempWall by Trusscore, to help with physical distancing. According to the company, the walls have been accepted for use in a number of hospitals and long-term care facilities. Trusscore noted that TempWall will continue to be a priority for the company through COVID-19 and beyond.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/temp-walls-trusscore-justin-trudeau-waterloo-region-1.5516432" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acknowledged</a> the work being done by Trusscore at one of his daily briefings in March. He pointed to the company providing the TempWall as an example of Canadian companies pitching during the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Waterloo-based Clearpath Robotics has raised a $40 million CAD ($29 million USD) Series C round. The capital will be used to further expand the company’s industrial autonomous mobile robot division, Otto Motors.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are ready for international expansion, and we have aspirations to be in many more countries.”<br />
&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>The round was led by Kensington Capital Partners through its Private Equity Fund. Rick Nathan, senior managing director at Kensington, will join Clearpath’s board of directors as part of the deal. The Series C round, which was entirely equity, also saw participation from Bank of Montreal Capital Partners, Export Development Canada (EDC), and previous investors, iNovia Capital and RRE Ventures.</p>
<p>EDC participated in the round through its newly launched <a href="https://betakit.com/edc-executive-vice-president-on-the-agencys-covid-19-response/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investment matching program</a>, part of the Crown corporation’s response to COVID-19. The program launched on a trial basis last month, looking to match investments of up to $5 million from venture capital and private equity investors for small-and-medium-sized businesses that export their products from Canada.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, Clearpath Robotics has since established itself as a leader in autonomous robotics development, creating one of the first platforms for robotics research. In 2015, the company established its Otto Motors division to focus on the use of autonomous mobile robots for materials handling in warehouses and factories. Clearpath continues to operate as its own division, selling autonomous vehicles for a variety of applications.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/bdc-capital-reveals-more-details-on-investment-matching-program-for-vc-backed-companies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BDC Capital reveals more details on investment matching program for VC-backed companies</a></strong></p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Matthew Rendall called the Clearpath division a global leader in a “very strategic and niche category,” noting that it has been profitable for almost 10 years.</p>
<p>This latest round of funding will be used to further expand Otto Motors, specifically looking to make “aggressive investments” in its autonomous vehicle technology.</p>
<p>“We have a portfolio of hardware products, these are the actual physical autonomous vehicles, we design and build those ourselves,” Rendall told BetaKit. “Those products are mature and in market. So, we&#8217;re shifting our focus much more now to the software that powers these vehicles.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EDt0jz4W4AIxfi6-212x300.jpeg" alt="" width="212" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-282305" srcset="https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EDt0jz4W4AIxfi6-212x300.jpeg 212w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EDt0jz4W4AIxfi6-409x580.jpeg 409w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EDt0jz4W4AIxfi6.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /></p>
<p>Otto Motors also plans to build out the “enterprise fleet management system” portion of its business, which Rendall called the “supervisory layer or air traffic controller for a network of autonomous vehicles.” The CEO noted that these types of systems are required by large manufacturers that have a “high bar for product performance.”</p>
<p>The industrial division of Clearpath Robotics also plans to use the newfound capital to grow its global network of delivery partners and accelerate its product roadmap for enterprise customers. </p>
<p>Otto Motors is working to grow its Fortune 500 customer base, its main clientele. According to the startup, more than 70 percent of autonomous mobile robots installed by Otto Motors are in Fortune Global 500 companies, including GE, Toyota, Nestle, and Berry Global.</p>
<p>Otto Motors mainly operates in the United States, with customers in Canada and Mexico as well. Earlier this year, Otto Motors <a href="https://betakit.com/kitchener-based-self-driving-industrial-robot-maker-otto-motors-expands-into-japan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expanded its operations</a> in the Japanese market with a partnership alongside Japan-based trading company Altech.</p>
<p>The partnership with Altech was one of Otto Motors’ first forays into developing its global network of delivery partners. The company is currently working to build out a network of certified installation partners to help make it easier to onboard and service international customers.</p>
<p>Otto Motors had originally entered the Japanese market in 2018, with “several successful deployments completed.” However, Rendall explained to BetaKit, “the further you get away from your home base, the more expensive it is for you to service and maintain your assets for your customers.”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve been working on building a playbook on how we work with partners close to home, to understand what their needs are, and build out a capability to support them,” he said. “We&#8217;ve got 40 or so certified partners supporting us in North America.”</p>
<p>The CEO said the company is now taking that playbook and “replicating it in key international geographies,” calling the move “the next horizon” for Otto Motors.</p>

<p>“Japan was the first kind of big stick in the ground to say, ‘we are ready for international expansion, and we have aspirations to be in many more countries,’” Rendall added, noting the strategic benefit of being in the Japanese market, which is a <a href="https://ifr.org/post/why-japan-leads-industrial-robot-production" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">leading</a> manufacturer and adopter of industrial robots.</p>
<p>Another recent partnership for its delivery network includes Berry Global Group, a Fortune 500 manufacturer. Using the Series C capital, Otto Motors plans to expand the network across North America, South America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific. </p>
<p>In recent months, Otto Motors reported a “surge in demand” for its robots, from essential businesses responding to increased operational risks due to COVID-19. Rendall pointed to sectors such as food, beverage, and medical device manufacturing, which are all seeing increased demand and at the same time the need to meet new health and safety practices.</p>
<p>“There are some businesses that can operate successfully entirely remotely; many software businesses, or IT businesses, services businesses, are able to be fully productive,” said Rendall. “But when you are producing a physical good, it is very, very challenging. It&#8217;s an existential threat to not be able to operate your manufacturing plant, and manufacturing businesses got reminded of that very swiftly when COVID came online.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Clearpath Robotics CEO noted that these factors have led to both existing and new Otto Motors customers accelerating their automation roadmap from a typical five-year plan to a six to 12-month timeframe.</p>

<p>“We&#8217;re seeing really, really aggressive acceleration in automation strategies,&#8221; Rendall said.</p>
<p>“With the COVID pandemic, we believe the market is going to accelerate, and the kind of growth that we might have expected in the market over the next three or four years we think we&#8217;ll see in one or two years,” Kensington’s Nathan added.</p>
<p>“The case for eliminating some of the risks involved in having no human workers is more compelling,” he told BetaKit, “Industrial automation and robotics, particularly in a factory environment, is, to me, a clear example of the kind of business that should get a boost from new risks that everybody&#8217;s become aware of, especially in an area where it was on a growth trajectory already.”</p>
<p>Otto Motors has not been immune to the negative effects of the pandemic, however. Due to COVID-19 health and safety measures, manufacturing and production plants are restricting access to outside visitors. This means that companies like Otto Motors are unable to enter to install new equipment.</p>

<p>Rendall predicts with planning, budgeting, and vendor selection happening now, “the automation wave is going to hit hard in 2021.” There are going to be “massive” ordering and install backlogs, he said, that will only begin clearing in 2021.</p>
<p>Prior to this Series C, Clearpath Robotics’ previously raised its <a href="https://betakit.com/clearpath-robotics-raises-39-million-series-b-to-shift-focus-to-factory-material-transport/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Series B round</a> of funding in 2016 &#8211; drawing in $39 million CAD ($30 million USD). Notably, this most recent round is $1 million smaller than its previous round.</p>
<p>“Our outlook on fundraising &#8230; we think about it a little bit differently,” Rendall said, explaining the reason for the smaller Series C. “Our goal is not to raise outside amounts of capital, and then grow something that&#8217;s not as efficient as it could be.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CEO further explained that Clearpath Robotics started as a bootstrapped company and was self-funded “very aggressively” for almost seven years before raising venture capital. He added that the company was profitable within 18 months of launching.</p>
<p>The decision to raise venture capital, Rendall told BetaKit, was always in pursuit of building out the Otto Motors division. “[The] Series B was really about hardening the [Otto Motors] product offering and Series C is about scale,” he said.</p>
<p>While it is not typical to see a company raise a smaller VC round than its previous raises, several VCs BetaKit spoke with on background explained it is not entirely unusual for profitable companies.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/trexo-robotics-wants-to-redefine-mobility-for-children-with-disabilities/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trexo Robotics wants to redefine mobility for children with disabilities</a></strong></p>
<p>One did note, however, that it is more common for software-as-service companies to raise less capital as compared to hardware-focused companies, which typically need more upfront cash to deliver products.</p>
<p>However, COVID-19 has provided what some VCs speaking to BetaKit have called “weird signals.”</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s no question that this is a tough time to raise money,” Nathan told BetaKit, predicting a “slow year” after <a href="https://betakit.com/report-canadian-vc-investments-set-record-in-2019-as-tech-sector-dominates/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previous</a> record-breaking years for VC in Canada.</p>
<p>“Because of COVID, we just decided, we&#8217;re not going to drag [Clearpath Robotics’ raise] out,” he said. “Everybody was unable to do meetings and kind of normal diligence. So, we had a debate among our team, and [Kensington was] comfortable because we started working on this [deal] quite a while ago. But, I think that in this environment, the decision, and I supported the decision, the decision to go ahead and close was really just expedience of the times.”</p>
<p>Rendall told BetaKit that closing the Series C was about being able to meet the increased demand from customers that are accelerating their automation roadmaps at an unprecedented pace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As COVID-19 forces angel investor groups to move their activities online, industry leaders have mixed views about the outlook for capital availability.</p>
<p>BetaKit spoke with the heads of three angel investor organizations, as well as industry association National Angel Capital Organization (NACO), to learn how their members are responding to COVID-19.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There was this one particular week in March, where over a couple of days, a number of individuals were losing&#8230;two or three million dollars.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>All three angel groups—Ontario’s Maple Leaf Angels (MLA), Georgian Angel Network (GAN), and Vancouver-based Angel Forum—have switched from live pitch-meetings to video conferencing.</p>
<p>Of the three angel groups, MLA took some of the most decisive action in response to the coronavirus, initially halting investor meetings “indefinitely.” But a rapid pivot saw MLA resume its activities shortly afterwards, with a relatively steady deal flow resulting.</p>
<p>“There was this one particular week in March, where over a couple of days, a number of individuals were losing half a million, to two or three million dollars in the public markets,” said managing director Prathna Ramesh. “So, at that time, my thinking was that these guys are not going to be thinking about angel investing, so we’ve got to ease off on our activities.”</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, MLA members gather once a month for about three hours. As the economic crisis deepened, Ramesh and her team polled about 75 percent of the organization’s investors about whether they were still open to new deals.</p>

<p>Despite the vast majority of respondents indicating that they planned to continue their angel activities, she and her team ultimately axed the March meeting in deference to the economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>But with members pushing for business to resume, Ramesh rebooted MLA’s sessions into an online-only format in time for April.</p>
<p>Attendance was strong. The in-person meetings usually attracted 50 to 65 attendees, most of whom numbered among the organization’s 80 or so members. The first virtual version attracted about 55 people, including representatives from three companies seeking funding, for a total that was comparable to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>For each company that pitched, the online event produced at least ten expressions of interest from investors who wanted to pursue due diligence, compared to 5 to 15 for the in-person meetings—suggesting that MLA members were still looking to do deals.</p>
<p>“How much of that translates into real money remains to be seen,” said Ramesh after the event. “But it was definitely promising.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“How much of that translates into real money remains to be seen. But it was definitely promising.”</p></blockquote>
<p>GAN and Angel Forum also saw recovering investor activity after weakness in April. However, NACO CEO Claudio Rojas warned that he is receiving potentially problematic feedback from entrepreneurs and angel investors.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Angel investors are focusing more-so on their existing portfolios,” Rojas said. “So what that means is that deals that, in a pre-COVID environment would have received funding, are going through a lengthier process or have altogether evaporated.”</p>
<p>How MLA attracts companies for potential investment has changed. Previously, companies often approached Ramesh and her team after discovering the group organically, such as via internet searches. Now, most of the entrepreneurs she deals with are referred to her from other players in the angel investment landscape.</p>
<p>“My hypothesis would be that new entrepreneurs, unless you’re addressing pandemic-related issues, are definitely being more cautious and probably waiting for the environment to stabilize,” she said.</p>

<p>GAN is likewise seeing indications that angel capital will continue to flow, bucking a downward trend that president and managing director Michael Badham noticed in April. The organization has also moved its monthly meetings online, but the director said members were initially more tentative in their approaches.</p>
<p>The angel group’s first video meeting was held on March 12 and attended by 17 people, a slight drop from the historical norm of 20 to 25, counting pitchers. One of the two pitching companies received a single investment and the other received no offers, compared to a past average of about five offers per company.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You focus on the ones that have survivability and work from there.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Badham said he suspected this was partly because GAN’s members, many of whom likely saw their net worths shrink when Canadian and US stock markets fell in March, were focusing their more limited funds on recapitalizing companies in which they had already invested.</p>
<p>The second meeting, held on April 23, proved more promising. Total attendance rose to 36, counting the pitching entrepreneurs and a couple of non-member spectators, which Badham said was a record for the 35-person network. One of the two startups has begun due diligence with six prospective investors.</p>
<p>GAN members are also signalling their continued willingness to do deals by renewing their annual memberships. Badham is contacting his angels to find out which of them are planning to stay with the group—a process he carries out every year—and so far, renewal rates are proving to be about the same as usual.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/capital-angel-network-invest-ottawa-announce-new-bootcamp-for-womxn-founders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Capital Angel Network, Invest Ottawa announce new bootcamp for womxn founders</a></strong></p>
<p>“I’m in what I would call a normal period,” he said. “Most people are renewing. A few are not, but I’m getting new members. It’s a little early to tell, but it’s all looking pretty positive right now.”</p>
<p>Angel Forum director Pieter Dorsman said on May 15 that he had seen similar evidence of recovering capital availability.</p>
<p>His group usually organizes full-day summits and pitch meetings for angel investors. In April, it switched exclusively to hour-long, weekly video meetings.</p>
<p>According to Dorsman, investors were initially more cautious than usual, which he attributed to them focusing their efforts on shoring up their portfolio companies that had the best chances of weathering the pandemic.</p>
<p>“A lot of time goes into the existing deals that are in trouble,” he said in April. “But you focus on the ones that have survivability and work from there.”</p>
<p>More recently, Angel Forum’s online attendance has risen to 40 or 50 people per week, and multiple attendees have been following up with entrepreneurs afterwards.</p>
<p>Unlike Ramesh, Dorsman has not noticed a change in the flow of investment opportunities.</p>
<p>“The Canadian ecosystem has grown so much,” he said. “There’s so many entrepreneurs, and immigrants and people doing new stuff that the flow keeps coming.”</p>

<p>NACO’s Rojas took a less immediately optimistic view of the industry landscape. His organization is in the process of polling both entrepreneurs and investors about capital availability, and the feedback is not promising.</p>
<p>The poll, which is being conducted in partnership with researchers from the University of Victoria, is so far suggesting that capital availability has decreased and will continue falling. Consistent with Badham and Dorsman’s experiences in March and April, angels appear to be prioritizing bailouts for companies in which they already own shares.</p>
<p>He added that whether or not that outlook changes will depend on the state of the broader economy.</p>
<p>“If we’re moving towards a period of gradual recovery, then we will see a greater inclination to invest,” said Rojas. “However, if there’s variability in that recovery, that’s where we could see a more significant pullback.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barry Gekiere, the managing director for the MaRS Investment Accelerator Fund (IAF) and longtime member of the Canadian venture capital ecosystem, has died. He was 68.</p>
<p>Gekiere passed suddenly on Friday, May 22, due to complications from ongoing cancer treatment. Diagnosed with a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma last year, Gekiere had been away from work getting treatment but still been actively supporting the MaRS IAF team remotely until the beginning of March.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Barry is a legend in the venture capital space in Canada, and his achievements and impact were profound.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, MaRS released <a href="https://marsdd.com/news/the-consummate-mentor-remembering-barry-gekiere/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a tribute</a> to Gekiere, calling him &#8220;a titan in Canada’s tech community.&#8221; Colleagues, entrepreneurs, and Gekiere&#8217;s son, Adam, all shared memories about his more than 25 years as a leader in the Canadian venture capital space.</p>
<p>“Barry is a legend in the venture capital space in Canada, and his achievements and impact were profound,&#8221; said Yung Wu, CEO of MaRS, who knew Gekiere for several decades. &#8220;He inspired and invested into an entire generation of Canada’s entrepreneurs. But what was exceptional is Barry, the human being. He was wise and provided no-nonsense advice, which always inevitably turned out to be very thoughtful insights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wu added that Barry brought decades of experience in venture capital, private equity, and operations to his work. &#8220;He was able to take all his learning and experiences and help those around him learn, become better and to make their own impact in this industry,&#8221; said Wu.</p>
<p>Gekiere was managing director of MaRS IAF for more than nine years, and in 2017 also helped launch StandUp Ventures alongside managing director, Michelle McBane, and investment manager, Snita Balsara.</p>
<p>“The difference with Barry was the way he connected with people,&#8221; McBane said in the tribute. &#8220;He always wanted a fair deal. He didn’t want to take advantage. He understood the long game. He had so much to contribute. He understood that his role was to be of service as an extension of the government.”</p>
<p>Prior to his time at MaRS, Gekiere was managing director of Kirchner Private Capital Group, a boutique investment banking firm providing merger and acquisition, as well as transition management services. Prior to that, he spent more than 12 years as partner of Ventures West Management, an early-stage VC fund focused on tech.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Barry was&#8230;persuasive through his effectiveness and mission of helping build the Toronto technology ecosystem.”</p></blockquote>
<p>MaRS IAF was created just over a decade ago as the Ontario provincial government was looking to create a seed fund that would &#8220;buffer the impact&#8221; of the 2008 financial crisis. The Ontario Centres of Excellence (OCE) was chosen to implement the fund, and Gekiere worked as a volunteer to help launch it. In 2011, the fund was transferred to MaRS.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I was trying to recruit him when the IAF moved to MaRS,” said Ilse Treurnicht, former CEO of MaRS, in the tribute. “He wasn’t looking for a full-time job and had not worked a lot with government (here the Limited Partner). He hesitated. Would the government interfere?”</p>
<p>“The fact that IAF ran for 10 years is a huge testament to Barry,” said Matt Golden, founder and managing partner of Golden Ventures. “Historically, publicly funded direct invest programs don’t last long due to shifting policies and administrations. But Barry was able to build a team and a process and demonstrate success quickly and early, ensuring the government could always see the high value delivered relative to the dollars invested. Barry was not a politician but he was persuasive through his effectiveness and mission of helping build the Toronto technology ecosystem.”</p>
<p>MaRS called Gekiere&#8217;s impact on MaRS IAF &#8220;nothing short of legendary.&#8221; According to the post, he &#8220;turned a $43 million investment of public money in a nascent fund into a self-sustaining pool of capital with $1.23 billion in follow-on funding.&#8221; Under his leadership, MaRS IAF reportedly invested in 150 companies, which included &#8220;some of the best in Ontario’s tech ecosystem.&#8221; MaRS IAF&#8217;s portfolio includes eSight, Fiix, MindBridge AI, and Maple, among others.</p>
<p>“When you think about the venture capital persona, they’re not known for their humanity. They’re not known for looking beyond the numbers,” said Wu. “Barry was none of those things. And his performance and the performance of the funds he managed never ever suffered because he was a different cat from how others act in the venture capital field.”</p>
<p>Gekiere leaves behind his wife, Victoria, his son, Adam, daughter-in-law, Katie, and his granddaughter, Lauren, who he had yet to meet in person as he was receiving treatment in Buffalo, New York, amid COVID-19. The Barry Gekiere Memorial Fund has been set up to support The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of Canada.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) officially launched its new program, CDL Recovery, focused on transforming tech innovations to aid in the current global crisis.</p>
<p>The Toronto-founded accelerator <a href="https://betakit.com/creative-destruction-lab-launches-covid-19-rapid-response-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> the program in early April as a way to rapidly turn innovations into useful products and services that could potentially aid in public health and economic recovery.</p>
<blockquote><p>“[We are] redeploying our resources to focus on the current crisis by applying the CDL model.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On Thursday, CDL officially kicked off its program after conceiving, designing, and launching the program within a period of eight weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;CDL’s mission is to accelerate the commercialization of science for the betterment of humankind,&#8221; CDL founder Ajay Agrawal said in a statement to BetaKit. &#8220;Right now, that means redeploying our resources to focus on the current crisis by applying the CDL model and community to rapidly translate science into solutions.”</p>
<p>While the program has started with some startups that have already been chosen to participate, applications for CDL Recovery are still open.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 accelerator is open to individuals and teams developing innovations that can directly address critical health or economic recovery challenges created by COVID-19. It will follow the traditional CDL program structure and is open to all types of innovative teams, including startups, corporations, informal collaborations, sole inventors, social impact ventures, and not-for-profit initiatives. The idea is to “anticipate and address” some of the most pressing needs that will arise over the next six to eighteen months.</p>

<p>CDL Recovery is focused on information-based solutions, with the accelerator noting that this does not include health solutions such as vaccines or PPE, automation that enables physical distancing, or goods and services that will experience an increase in demand due to physical-distancing restrictions. CDL noted &#8220;these are important and will be included in the core CDL streams that will resume in the fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Examples of innovations that the COVID-19 program will focus on include, &#8220;managerial decision-making tools&#8221; such as swab-based tests that predict whether the coronavirus is present in an individual, contact tracing, image analysis of people density or proximity, symptom monitoring, and workplace monitoring of air or sewage.</p>
<p>Traditionally a regional-based accelerator program, CDL has foregone that approach for CDL Recovery and is running the virtual program globally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fifteen percent of Canadians are currently working in occupations projected to decline by the year 2030, while 19 percent are in occupations expected to grow in demand, according to a new report from the Brookfield Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The global pandemic and accompanying economic crisis will undoubtedly have an impact on these trends.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://brookfieldinstitute.ca/report/ahead-by-a-century-employment-in-2030" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">findings</a> result from the institution&#8217;s final forecast report of its Employment in 2030 research project. The Brookfield Institute, housed at Ryerson University, <a href="https://betakit.com/brookfield-institute-announces-research-project-looking-at-employment-in-2030/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> the initiative in March 2019. Employment in 2030 aimed to forecast employment skills that will be in demand a decade from now.</p>
<p>Using the “Forecast of Canadian Occupational Growth” tool (a combination of expert insights and machine learning), the latest report explored what Brookfield Institute called “the uneven implications of the forecast” and what they mean for different industries, geographies and demographic groups, highlighting those that may be most vulnerable.</p>
<p>The institute found that jobs in health and science, as well as those requiring a “high degree of service orientation or technical expertise” are projected to increase in employment share by 2030. At the same time, manufacturing and utilities occupations are projected to decrease in employment share.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-moving-vast-majority-of-employees-to-permanent-remote-work/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shopify moving “vast majority” of employees to permanent remote work</a></strong></p>
<p>Overall, the study found that 66 percent of workers in Canada are in occupations projected to remain stable in employment share, while 15 percent currently work in occupations projected to decline with 19 percent expected to grow in demand.</p>
<p>The institute <a href="https://betakit.com/ai-could-disrupt-workforce-in-every-sector-by-2030-brookfield-report-finds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously predicted</a> that artificial intelligence (AI) would potentially disrupt every industry within the next decade, requiring all companies to have AI-related occupations. Brookfield Institute indicated the trend has the potential to make it “highly competitive” to retain talent.</p>
<p>The latest report found that workers with higher education and incomes, as well as first-generation immigrants, are more likely to be in occupations that are projected to grow. The same can be said for visible minority workers, Brookfield Institute reported, while noting that “certain groups may face more risk.”</p>
<p>Many of the findings of this final report were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the institute said the results “provide a very helpful guide for thinking about long-term employment and skills trends in Canada between now and 2030.”</p>
<p>“The global pandemic and accompanying economic crisis will undoubtedly have an impact on these trends,” said Sean Mullin, executive director of the Brookfield Institute. “Some trends may accelerate, new ones will emerge, others may slow down or stop.”</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/toronto-tech-sector-sees-16-6-percent-jump-in-employment-from-2018/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Toronto tech sector sees 16.6 percent jump in employment from 2018</a></strong></p>
<p>“But, many of these trends are deeply rooted in economic, social, political, technological, and environmental changes that we believe will continue,” he added. “And the time frame of the forecast &#8211; targeting 2030, not 2021 &#8211; is designed to focus on the long-term.”</p>
<p>Other reports that came out of the Employment in 2030 initiative <a href="https://betakit.com/report-slow-uneven-tech-adoption-will-shape-the-future-of-canadas-workforce/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forecast</a> strong trends toward technological disruption in the Canadian workforce. Institute experts pointed to potential new professions such as AI ethicists, VR educators, dark web detectives, digital identity protectors, cannabis sommeliers, and VR doctors. Some of these trends, such as virtual medicine and education, are already beginning to emerge amid COVID-19.</p>
<p>In October, the Brookfield Institute also released a proposed <a href="https://betakit.com/brookfield-institute-reveals-career-pathways-model-for-jobs-disrupted-by-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">model</a> for finding new pathways for employers and workers amid technological disruption.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Québec-based artificial intelligence (AI) supercluster <a href="https://www.scaleai.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scale AI</a> is investing $10 million to support the creation of at least ten university chairs dedicated to AI across the country. This contribution will double the amount committed by Canadian universities, bringing the total commitment to $20 million.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Scale AI is making strategic investments to build capacity in the AI ecosystem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The goal of the university chairs is to attract and retain AI researchers, support research programs, and develop AI experts at post-secondary institutions. The supercluster said this is a part of its AI talent development strategy in Québec and across the country.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>“To develop a truly collaborative and flourishing ecosystem, we must encourage the emergence of talents who can generate mutually beneficial interactions and new Canadian intellectual property sources,” said Julien Billot, CEO of Scale AI. “It is for this reason that we believe the creation of several AI research chairs is an additional lever to attract talent and stimulate innovation at all levels.”</p>
<p>Hélène Desmarais, co-chair of the Scale AI board of directors, said the increase in demand for AI experts has caused many large tech companies to hire professors, which creates a problem for universities. She said universities now need experts to train students and researchers in AI. </p>
<p>Canada is home to a number of institutes and universities specializing in AI research, such as the University of Toronto organizations like Mila and the Vector Institute. Many key researchers have gone on to work for foreign tech giants like Uber and Facebook, in what has been called the Canadian <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/canadian-brain-grab-intensifies-as-facebook-hires-two-montreal-ai-experts/article36274647/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brain grab</a>, in which many researchers leave academia for the private sector. </p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/element-ai-report-shows-artificial-intelligence-talent-leaving-canada/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Element AI report shows artificial intelligence talent leaving Canada</a></strong></p>
<p>Navdeep Bains, minister of innovation, science and industry, said the university chairs will bolster skill development and provide a resource to Scale AI’s industry partners to leverage the AI expertise of Canadian researchers.</p>
<p>“I am glad to see Scale AI is making strategic investments to build capacity in the AI ecosystem and create IP that can help industry partners in their efforts to grow and expand,” Bains added.</p>
<p>Scale AI is part of the federal government’s Innovation Supercluster Initiative. In 2018, the federal government committed <a href="https://betakit.com/prime-minister-announces-230-million-for-scale-ai-supercluster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$230 million</a> to Scale AI over five years, and additional funding of $53.4 million was also granted by the Government of Québec. </p>
<p>Despite the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Scale AI has still been actively investing in projects that fulfill its mandate. Earlier this month, the supercluster invested <a href="https://betakit.com/alayacare-dialogue-among-projects-receiving-3-4-million-from-scale-ai-supercluster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$3.4 million</a> into eight projects specifically focused on solutions addressing challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Other superclusters, such as the Atlantic Canada-based <a href="https://betakit.com/ocean-supercluster-calling-for-projects-that-support-canadas-ocean-sector-during-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oceans Supercluster</a> and the <a href="https://betakit.com/1qbit-alayacare-among-latest-projects-to-receive-support-from-digital-technology-supercluster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Technology Supercluster</a> in British Columbia, are also moving ahead with programs aimed to help the federal government address the current crisis. The government <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-government-refocuses-innovation-procurement-programs-in-fight-against-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">refocused</a> innovation programs like the supercluster initiative in March due to the pandemic. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toronto-based <a href="https://behrtech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BehrTech</a>, a startup that develops wireless connectivity products for the Internet of Things (IoT), has received a $3 million grant from a joint funding program between the federal government and a non-profit organization.</p>
<blockquote><p>The lab is expected to hold equipment to develop, analyze, and integrate Industrial IoT sensors.</p></blockquote>
<p>The funding came from a program through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (<a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NSERC</a>) and the Canada Foundation for Innovation (<a href="https://www.innovation.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CFI</a>). The grant will be used to create and staff an Industrial IoT lab solely dedicated to sensors, communications, applied research, and integration.</p>
<p>“This grant is testimony to BehrTech’s innovation and contribution to the sensor and communication technologies market,” said Albert Behr, CEO of BehrTech. “The new equipment and infrastructure will enable us to further develop the wireless IoT sensors needed to overcome the connectivity barriers that are currently plaguing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/09/02/what-is-industry-4-0-heres-a-super-easy-explanation-for-anyone/#58552c769788" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Industry 4.0</a>.”</p>
<p>The lab, which will be based in Toronto, is expected to hold equipment to develop, analyze, and integrate innovative Industrial IoT sensors. BehrTech said the lab will also be a “trial platform” for prototypes ahead of full-scale demonstrations and deployment.</p>

<p>IoT refers to a network of “endpoints,” or “things,” that communicate through the internet, WiFi, or other wireless protocols. According to a <a href="https://itac.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ITAC-Seizing-the-IoT-Opportunity-June-2016.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">whitepaper</a> from the Information Technology Association of Canada, although IoT is still in its infancy in Canada, it could have a global economic impact of $4 to $11 trillion per year by 2025.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, BehrTech offers a wireless connectivity software platform that is built for large-scale Industrial IoT, which works with computers&#8217; industrial applications, including manufacturing and energy management. </p>
<p>NSERC and CFI’s grant program connects colleges with local companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, to work together on applied research projects that will facilitate the development of new products and technologies. For this project, BehrTech will work alongside partners <a href="https://bgcengineering.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BGC Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.molok.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Molok</a>, <a href="https://www.ecoation.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ecoation</a>, <a href="https://www.ioairflow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ioAirFlow</a>, and <a href="https://www.aoms-tech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aoms</a>.</p>
<p>NSERC is the major federal agency responsible for funding natural sciences and engineering research in Canada. NSERC directly funds professors, students, and Canadian companies to perform research and training.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.elementai.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Element AI</a> has launched two new artificial intelligence (AI) collaborations in Asia-Pacific, one with a South Korean investment advisory company, and the other with a consortium based in Singapore. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Market forecasters are turning to AI-powered solutions to help them quickly identify signals and better manage.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In South Korea, Element AI will be working with <a href="http://www.shinhangroup.com/en/introduce/groupIntroduce1_16.jsp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shinhan AI</a>, an AI-powered investment advisory firm. This partnership will see the Montréal-based startup integrate its AI technology with Shinan AI’s platform, called <a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3067622" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Neo</a>, in order to simplify and accelerate application and forecasting decisions for its index tracker with a new market prediction model.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shinhan AI, which is a Shinhan Financial Group subsidiary, will develop Neo 2.0, an upgrade of its existing investment consulting platform.</p>
<p>“Element AI is working with Shinhan AI to offer both its financial professionals and end-users a state-of-the-art forecasting algorithm that will differentiate the Neo 2.0 platform, leveraging AI to learn and adapt, potentially beating other forecasting methods with faster, more accurate price index predictions,” said Ben Eum, director of North Asia at Element AI. </p>
<p>Through this collaboration, Element AI will apply its algorithms to offer a new approach to forecasting equity indexes while providing for future resiliency to additional asset classes. Shinhan Financial Group was one of Element AI’s first partners. The two organizations signed a memorandum of understanding of May 2019. </p>

<p>“As we have witnessed with unpredictable ‘black swan’ events like the COVID-19 pandemic, market forecasters are turning to AI-powered solutions to help them quickly identify signals and better manage their predictions when the market is behaving abnormally,” Eum added. </p>
<p>Element AI plans to continue to work with Shinhan AI on researching, developing and deploying more AI solutions.</p>
<p>The second partnership for Element AI is a <a href="https://www.aithority.com/machine-learning/element-ai-announces-collaboration-with-veritas-consortium-led-by-mas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collaboration</a> with the Veritas Consortium led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MAS</a>). Element AI will assist in developing a framework for driving the responsible adoption of AI in the financial services industry. </p>
<p>Element AI&#8217;s involvement will include research and development activities aimed to support the consortium’s mandate to build a “vibrant and responsible environment” for AI adoption. </p>
<p>One of Element AI’s first initiatives will be completed with the United Overseas Bank (<a href="https://www.uobgroup.com/uobgroup/index.page" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UOB</a>). The two organizations will develop metrics for financial institutions to assess how data and the algorithms or models used to evaluate credit scoring for unsecured lending meet the consortium’s principles of fairness.</p>

<p>“As a founding member of the Veritas initiative and through our collaboration with Element AI, we aim to develop a set of metrics which could be used as an industry benchmark that upholds the fairness principle in the area of credit scoring for unsecured lending,” said Johnson Poh, head of group enterprise AI and data science at UOB’s data management office. </p>
<p>The overall goal of the Singapore collaboration is to publish a research report on the project and to open-source the code for the metrics for AI practitioners to review and use within their own organizations. The report is expected to be published in the second half of this year.</p>
<p>These partnerships follow Element AI appointing its first chief financial officer and chief revenue officer, after an internal restructuring that resulted in 15 percent of the company being <a href="https://betakit.com/today-in-hires-hootsuite-element-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">laid off</a>. Earlier this year, Element AI <a href="https://betakit.com/element-ai-launches-third-standalone-product-access-governor/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched</a> its third standalone product as well as an R&#038;D partnership with <a href="https://betakit.com/darwinai-brings-explainability-platform-to-aerospace-industry-through-lockheed-martin-partnership/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LG</a>. Last year, the startup launched its first two products and raised a <a href="https://betakit.com/element-ai-announces-200-million-cad-series-b-round/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$200 million CAD</a> Series B in September.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Atlantic Women’s Venture Fund (AWVF) has officially launched its inaugural fund as the group looks to address, head-on, the existing gender imbalance in Canada’s venture capital ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Women entrepreneurs generate more revenues and more profits, and I have all of the data to back it up.&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Along with the fund launch, AWVF has also announced that Danielle Graham, formerly of Dream Maker Ventures, has joined to take a leading role in the funds investment activities. Graham is set to officially join Sandpiper as of June 1.</p>
<p>The fund, called Sandpiper Venture, will target early-stage women tech entrepreneurs across Canada “as a proactive and profitable business decision.”</p>
<p>“We as an economy are missing out on potential or missing out on innovation,” Graham said in an interview with BetaKit. “Women entrepreneurs generate more revenues and more profits, and I have all of the data to back it up … we&#8217;ve derived a lot of data points that show how problematic it is right now [that women receive less investment capital than men].”</p>
<p>Sandpiper is founded by a group of nine leading entrepreneurs, investors, and executives (in addition to Graham), each of whom invested in the fund and are part of its advisory committee.</p>
<div id="attachment_282082" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-282082" src="https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Danielle-Sandpiper-photoshoot-1-1-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-282082" srcset="https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Danielle-Sandpiper-photoshoot-1-1-240x300.jpg 240w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Danielle-Sandpiper-photoshoot-1-1-464x580.jpg 464w, https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Danielle-Sandpiper-photoshoot-1-1.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><p id="caption-attachment-282082" class="wp-caption-text">Danielle Graham, Investment Principal, Sandpiper Ventures.</p></div>
<p>Sandpiper’s investment team is made up of Rhiannon Davies, the former VP and board director at GrandVision N.V, Sarah Young, managing partner of public relations firm National, and Cathy Bennet, the former Newfoundland and Labrador finance minister. The three women have all personally invested in Sandpiper and will serve as general partners for the fund, making investment decisions alongside Graham, who will serve as Investment Principal.</p>
<p>Other notable investors in Sandpiper include Amy Risely, CEO of Skinfix, Shannon MacDonald, managing director of Accenture Canada, and Nicole LeBlanc, director of investments and partnerships at Sidewalk Labs, among others.</p>
<p>The AWVF has been <a href="http://entrevestor.com/ac/blog/womens-fund-eyes-spring-launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working</a> to launch Sandpiper over the past year, with a target size of $20 million. The fund is looking to raise capital from private and public investors and, to date, has closed 50 percent of its private capital goal. While Davies would not confirm the dollar amount raised, she told BetaKit it is less than $10 million. Sandpiper is still actively fundraising to reach its target.</p>
<p>Davies, who also co-founded the AWVF, told BetaKit the group is trying to create a platform to engage women as founders, investors, and mentors. Sandpiper, she explained, is the inaugural fund in that platform, with the intention of providing a base with enough capital to “make a difference.”</p>

<p>“For us, in general, it&#8217;s really about driving diversity and creating better companies and not sort of creating a parallel ecosystem that is all women for women,” she said. “But just recognizing that diversity makes better decision making, and if you have different lenses around your management table you&#8217;re going to build better businesses.”</p>
<p>The group behind the AWVF has been active in the Atlantic Canada entrepreneurial and tech space for some while, through programming and angel investing. Graham highlighted that the all-women team behind Sandpiper is purposeful.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s an all women’s team, and that’s what’s unique about it.&#8221;<br />
<em> &#8211; Danielle Graham, Sandpiper Ventures</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“It&#8217;s an all women&#8217;s team, and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s unique about it,” she told BetaKit. “We have incredible women business leaders [backing Sandpiper] that have proven their acumen within multiple industries. [They have] built companies, they&#8217;ve enabled them to go internationally, they&#8217;ve done mergers and acquisitions … this is already a well-established community, and we want to enable that business leadership in the next generation of women.&#8221;</p>
<p>While investment in underrepresented founders and women-led companies has increased over the past number of years, women entrepreneurs and venture capitalists continue to receive significantly less capital than their male counterparts.</p>
<p>According to a Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) <a href="https://www.bdc.ca/en/about/sme_research/pages/changing-face-of-canadian-entrepreneurship.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from 2019, women account for 28 percent of all entrepreneurs in Canada. However, other statistics show they raised just <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-you-shouldnt-need-to-be-a-man-to-get-venture-capital-funding-in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four percent</a> of venture capital funding available last year.</p>
<p>When it comes to women in the VC space, the number of women in partnership roles increased over the past year, however, women-led funds only received <a href="https://betakit.com/despite-more-canadian-women-vc-partners-lp-dollars-still-go-to-all-male-funds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">15 percent</a> of available LP dollars in Canada.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/standup-ventures-holds-final-close-secures-21-million-for-women-focused-fund/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">StandUp Ventures holds final close, secures $21 million for women-focused fund</a></strong></p>
<p>LeBlanc told BetaKit that one of the “most exciting things” that has come out of building Sandpiper is actively engaging female business leaders in the Atlantic Canada region that may not have traditionally participated in the startup or innovation ecosystem.</p>
<p>“This is something that really grabbed their attention and they are now going to be participating in the fund, they’re now able to be advisors and board members to startups, they&#8217;re able to now participate more actively,” she said.</p>
<p>“Supporting women entrepreneurs is not anti-male,” added Graham. “It&#8217;s just about saying, ‘we&#8217;re connected on this level and you know what, it&#8217;s okay that men connect with each other. We just need more engagement.’&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandpiper plans to invest in pre-seed and seed deals, cutting cheques within the $250,000 to $500,000 range. With a target of $20 million, Sandpiper hopes to make 35 to 40 deals, keeping about 50 percent for follow-on investments. The fund plans to invest in companies that are led by women who have an equal equity share at the founder level. </p>
<p>Graham told BetaKit Sandpiper is looking to close the fund and begin investing within the next three to six months. She noted, however, that given the economic challenges Canadian startups are currently facing around COVID-19, Sandpiper is willing to close earlier in order to provide financial support, so as not to “lose valuable companies” that are currently struggling because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Graham is joining the AWVF from Dream Maker Ventures where she served as principal. She joined what is the investment arm of Dream Maker Inc. last year as it looked to raise a <a href="https://betakit.com/danielle-graham-joins-dream-maker-ventures-as-firm-targets-75-million-diversity-fund/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$75 million Diversity Fund</a>. While at Dream, Graham helped launch the <a href="https://betakit.com/dream-maker-ventures-launches-network-to-connect-underrepresented-founders-funders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dream Network</a>, an initiative meant to connect underrepresented founders with potential investment opportunities, as well as Dream Legacy Foundation’s <a href="https://betakit.com/dream-maker-ventures-launches-diversity-program-for-underrepresented-entrepreneurs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Diversity Program</a> initiative.</p>
<p>The Dream Legacy Foundation recently received support from <a href="https://betakit.com/microsoft-dream-legacy-foundation-partner-to-support-underrepresented-founders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Microsoft for Startups Canad</a>a to help diverse founders in the Canadian tech ecosystem.</p>

<p>Regarding her decision to move to Sandpiper, Graham told BetaKit, “without a woman [in a company leadership role], to me, what real impact am I making? I always defined it that way, and Sandpiper and the Atlantic Women&#8217;s Venture Fund have allowed me to unlock that capital [so] that I can now directly invest in the types of founders that I&#8217;ve been wanting to work with since I began.&#8221;</p>
<p>Graham, who also founded the first female-focused accelerator and bootcamp series in Canada, Fierce Founders, also recently helped launch <a href="https://betakit.com/new-investor-network-archangel-launches-fund-in-response-to-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The ArchAngel Network of Funds</a>. An active angel investor, Graham will continue to serve as a venture partner for one of the network’s funds.</p>
<p>Just prior to announcing the launch of Sandpiper, the AWVF helped launch an <a href="https://betakit.com/the51-atlantic-womens-venture-fund-partner-on-women-focused-venture-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initiative</a> alongside Calgary-based angel investment platform The51. Dubbed Canada51, in reference to women being 51 percent of the global population, the initiative is about creating a formal, national collective of organizations and individuals supporting women entrepreneurs across the country.</p>
<p>“It’s time for us to invest in what looks like us,” said Shelley Kuipers, co-founder of The51, at the time. “We know we can transform Canada’s economy in this decade and beyond and our partnership with [the Atlantic Women’s Venture Fund] is pivotal to stitching this next economic wave together.”</p>
<p>While Sandpiper is based in Atlantic Canada, it plans to invest in women-led companies from across the country. Graham highlighted to BetaKit that even though Sandpiper is a women-led fund, it “welcomes people of all genders to invest as limited partners.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since launching in early April, the Paycheck Protection Program (<a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PPP</a>), a COVID-19 relief initiative in the United States that provides small businesses with forgivable loans, has been met with <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/loans/2020/ppp-loan-demand-peters-out-amid-smb-confusion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">high levels</a> of demand and uncertainty. One recent survey indicated that <a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/borrowers-paycheck-protection-program-confusion-loan-terms/578577/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">75 percent</a> of borrowers report being confused about the program.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We&#8217;re looking to empower the lenders to really proactively serve their borrowers and their business clients.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Keren Moynihan, Boss Insights</em></p></blockquote>
<p>To combat some of the confusion, one Canadian startup is stepping in to help. <a href="https://bossinsights.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boss Insights</a>, a Toronto-based SaaS company, has repurposed its existing insights software to launch a new platform that helps lenders and borrowers navigate PPP loans. </p>
<p>The new platform, called <a href="https://bossinsights.com/solutions/cares-ppp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boss CARES</a>, covers the application, monitoring, and forgiveness calculation of PPP loans. Borrowers can connect their accounting, financial, and payroll systems to Boss Insights’ platform, while lenders can see that information at the company and portfolio level. </p>
<p>With a connection to small business payroll data, Boss Insights is addressing compliance as well as the forgiveness component of the PPP loans.</p>
<p>On March 27, the United States signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (<a href="https://bench.co/blog/operations/cares-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CARES</a>) Act into law. The law is aimed at supporting small businesses through the current pandemic. One of the measures in the bill is the PPP, a nearly $660 billion USD program intended to provide American small businesses with eight weeks of cash-flow assistance through 100 percent federally-guaranteed loans.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the program, businesses have eight weeks from the day they receive the cash to spend it in order for the loan to be forgiven. However, the program has become muddled for many small businesses as the US federal government is continually <a href="https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2020/may/ppp-loan-forgiveness-guidance-issued-as-congress-mulls-changes.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">updating</a> existing guidelines and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/paycheck-protection-program-changes-trip-up-small-businesses-11589288403" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publishing</a> new ones. It’s up to lenders, such as credit unions and community banks, to calculate a borrower’s forgiveness on the PPP loan. </p>
<p>“The calculation to get that up and running is so complicated, and we&#8217;ve automated it,” Boss Insights CEO Keren Moynihan told BetaKit.</p>
<p>“Before COVID, there were 15,000 financial institutions lending 15,000 different ways. Now, there are over 5,400 [financial institutions] lending in one way. [It is] the equivalent of a financial flash mob,” she added.</p>

<p>Founded in 2017, Boss Insights aggregates real-time data on companies and provides insights for startups, accelerators, and investors. Moynihan told BetaKit the first version of Boss CARES was spun up in only four days. Since then, the US government has issued many changes, and Moynihan said Boss Insights adopted them within the week they are issued.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re looking to empower the lenders to really proactively serve their borrowers and their business clients, and so switching from a regular platform to PPP [was] easy,” Moynihan told BetaKit. </p>
<blockquote><p>“I just hope that it can inspire maybe people in Canada to consider us too.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Boss CARES platform <a href="https://bossinsights.com/news/boss-insights-collaborates-with-oracle-to-release-boss-cares-ppp-powered-by-oracle-cloud/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched</a> in late April with computer technology corporation Oracle. Boss Insight’s platform includes a portal that the borrower and lender can access, and gathers data from various sources automatically to verify ongoing monitoring and forgiveness eligibility.</p>
<p>“I just hope that it can inspire maybe people in Canada to consider us too,” Moynihan added. The CEO noted that Boss Insights felt it needed to take the approach of finding success outside of Canada before being able to scale nationally.</p>

<p>Boss Insights is currently in the process of raising a $2.8 million CAD seed round, 30 percent of which is currently subscribed, Moynihan told BetaKit. She said the round has already secured debt funding from Business Development Bank of Canada, and that there are also several US investors locked in, that are waiting for a lead investor.</p>
<p>Moynihan said she thinks Canada has believed in the company from a grant perspective, but not a market perspective. Many members of Canada’s tech community have cited the country’s tight regulatory environment as one of the key inhibiting factors for FinTech adoption. A 2019 report from Ernst &#038; Young found that FinTech adoption in Canada still <a href="https://betakit.com/lagging-regulation-consumer-trust-inhibiting-fintech-adoption-in-canada/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lags</a> behind the global average. </p>
<p>Koho CEO Daniel Eberhard <a href="https://betakit.com/incumbents-consumer-complacency-barriers-to-innovation-in-canadian-banking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed</a> to BetaKit earlier last year that the regulatory environment in Canada has made it much more difficult to succeed as a Fintech startup, as regulators have prioritized managing risk over fostering a competitive environment.</p>
<p>Moynihan said Canadian banks lack the “systematic ability” to drive FinTech adoption in Canada, however, Boss Insights is currently in talks with a major Canadian bank. </p>
<p>“I hope that the spirit of collaboration continues after COVID,” Moynihan said. “It&#8217;s the necessity that&#8217;s making things work in this way. We&#8217;re all sort of banding together to find a common goal.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google Canada is committing $1 million to <a href="https://digitalmainstreet.ca/shophere/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ShopHERE</a> to help expand the Digital Main Street program across Canada. Google Canada’s commitment will be used to set up 50,000 online stores across the country. </p>
<blockquote><p>“The partnership with Google is basically taking the model we&#8217;ve built in Toronto&#8230; and making it available to municipalities across the country.”</p></blockquote>
<p>ShopHERE, <a href="https://betakit.com/city-leading-toronto-tech-initiative-to-get-local-small-businesses-online/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched</a> earlier this month, was initially a City of Toronto initiative focused on building online storefronts for local independent businesses and artists. Since the ShopHERE launched in Toronto, 700 developers have volunteered to build over 6,000 online stores and over 1,000 stores are currently being developed. Now, the program will expand to municipalities across Canada, with the support of Google and several other organizations.  </p>
<p>“The partnership with Google is basically taking the model that we&#8217;ve built in Toronto to support independent small businesses and artists, and making it available to municipalities across the country,” said Chris Rickett, who recently <a href="https://betakit.com/city-of-toronto-reclaims-startup-lead-as-it-restructures-to-better-fight-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">returned</a> to the City of Toronto from the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation as the acting director for COVID-19 business mitigation and recovery to support businesses in Toronto during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see the partnerships we built to support Toronto’s small businesses and artists can now be accessed in municipalities across Canada,&#8221; Rickett told BetaKit. &#8220;ShopHERE was always about ensuring the life that independent businesses and artists bring to our communities can survive this crisis. Having Canadian tech jump in to support neighbourhoods across the country is truly inspiring.”</p>
<p>Calgary, Markham, Vaughan, Brampton, Hamilton, Kitchener, and Stratford have all signed onto the national initiative. ShopHERE will begin rolling out in select municipalities next month. </p>
<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit, businesses across the country have been forced to close their doors. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, these business closures hit small and medium-sized businesses the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/oecd-updates-g20-summit-on-outlook-for-global-economy.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hardest</a>. </p>
<p>In Toronto, the development of online stores through ShopHERE is being completed by volunteer developers, students from the Schulich School of Business, and Magnet, a platform that connects job seekers with opportunities. For the national program, ShopHERE will continue to leverage volunteers initially, but plans to bring more students into the initiative, who will be paid to develop the stores with assistance from Magnet.</p>

<p>Program partner Shopify has also agreed to provide its platform at no cost to participating companies across Canada for three months, in addition to training and support for students. Other companies, like Microsoft, Facebook, Google, eBay, eShipper and Mastercard, are providing support through free ad credits or cybersecurity software for the national program.</p>
<p>To be eligible for the national initiative, businesses must have fewer than 10 employees, or fewer than 25 if the business is a cafe, restaurant, or bar. Businesses that are part of a franchise or chain are not eligible for the program. ShopHERE is also expanding eligibility to include home-based businesses. </p>
<p>Since Rickett’s return, the City of Toronto also recently launched an online donation platform created by a group of tech entrepreneurs allowing the public to make direct donations to local small businesses across Canada. The platform, called <a href="https://betakit.com/tech-entrepreneurs-launch-donation-platform-to-help-canadian-local-businesses-affected-by-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Distantly</a>, is aimed to cover businesses’ overhead costs as they weather the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Digital Main Street has helped 15,000 main street small businesses adopt digital technologies and e-commerce platforms, according to a progress <a href="https://obiaa.com/projects/digital-main-street/news/?c=digital-main-street-report" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> by the Ontario Business Improvement Area Association.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bryan de Lottinville, the founder of corporate social responsibility software startup Benevity, is departing his role as CEO of the company, BetaKit has learned....]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bryan de Lottinville, the founder of corporate social responsibility software startup Benevity, is departing his role as CEO of the company, BetaKit has learned.</p>
<p>The announcement was made internally to Benevity employees Wednesday, with the Calgary-based company confirming the transition to BetaKit. As of June 1, de Lottinville will step down from his role as CEO to take on a new position as executive chairman. In a statement to BetaKit, de Lottinville noted that the transition had been in the works for &#8220;many months.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Earlier this month, Benevity announced that Nudge.AI co-founder Steven Woods had joined as CTO.</p></blockquote>
<p>Citing plans to spend more time with his family, the outgoing CEO said he also plans to continue direct involvement with Benevity, including spending time with many of the company&#8217;s clients, and building &#8220;the category of corporate purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrew Huddart, formerly CEO of professional training group TwentyEight, is set to replace de Lottinville as Benevity&#8217;s CEO. In his statement, de Lottinville noted Benevity went through an &#8220;exhaustive search&#8221; to find his replacement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Andrew comes to Benevity with deep experience in the Human Capital Management space, having led companies that specialized in learning and development, leadership training, employee engagement consulting and content, in addition to some time spent in fintech – all areas that are relevant to the challenges and aspirations of the initiatives run by CSR and social impact leaders,&#8221; de Lottinville said.</p>
<p>Huddart has held several different leadership positions in global technology and content companies over the years, notably as president of Korn Ferry’s Global Products Group, Moody&#8217;s KMV, and CEO of investment advisor mPower. </p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/benevity-is-taking-its-corporate-social-responsibility-platform-mobile/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Benevity is taking its corporate social responsibility platform mobile</a></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;This unique combination of experience and someone who exhibits Benevity’s core values and passion for our social mission is not easy to come by, and from our quest on both sides of the border, we determined Andrew is that person,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>This is the second executive leadership turnover in recent weeks for Benevity. Earlier this month, the company <a href="https://betakit.com/nudge-ai-co-founder-steven-woods-joins-benevity-as-chief-technology-officer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that Eloqua and Nudge.AI co-founder Steven Woods had joined as CTO. Woods took over the role from Benevity co-founder Jason Becker, who served as interim CTO for seven months during the search for a permanent replacement. Becker remains with Benevity as vice president of architecture.</p>
<p>The change in CEO and CTO follows several recent senior technology hires at Benevity, including vice president of engineering, John Mortimer, who joined the team in September, and vice president of product, Grant Bryce, who started in November.</p>
<p>Benevity was founded in 2008 as a platform that enables companies to engage their employees and customers around social responsibility and community investment, hoping to create better business and social impacts. The startup, which is one of the largest startups in the Prairies, raised a <a href="https://betakit.com/calgary-based-benevity-raises-40-million-in-series-c/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$40 million Series C</a> in October. Benevity has grown to more than 600 employees and built out a customer base of more than 600 clients spanning large, global enterprises like Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Google, and Honda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve years ago, when Benevity set out to make Goodness a part of peoples’ everyday lives, we were unfettered by deep knowledge of the complexities of the CSR and enterprise software space,&#8221; said de Lottinville. &#8220;We wanted to build a platform that would better weave meaning, purpose and impact into the fabric of society, and to use the power of companies to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fortunately, in our early days, we discovered a little niche in the corporate world filled with passionate kindreds who were also trying to make &#8216;doing well by doing good&#8217; more than just a catchy tagline,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Nike led to Google led to Apple led to many other large enterprises embracing the power of social impact through Benevity to improve attraction, retention, and productivity of their employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his statement, de Lottinville highlighted his decision was connected to spending more time with his wife and children and expressed hopes to be able to support his wife&#8217;s career. &#8220;I also want to walk the talk a bit more on being a feminist,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;I have a spouse that has subordinated her career to mine, despite likely being more talented and ambitious than me. I hope to support her career for the next few years, the way that she has done for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The outgoing CEO also expressed plans to support local community initiatives in Calgary, including the Mental Health &#038; Addiction Stewardship Committee, as well as using Benevity as &#8220;a poster child for the success of a once start-up now grown-up tech company in Canada.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;With the runway ahead of me, all of these things give me a renewed sense of energy about the impact and legacy I have always hoped to leave behind,&#8221; he said. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toronto-based <a href="https://phelix.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Phelix.ai</a>, a startup that develops automation tools for the health sector, has raised a $1 million seed round. The round was led by <a href="https://www.well.company/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Well Health Technologies</a>, which contributed $250,000. Other investors were not disclosed. </p>
<blockquote><p>”Our suite of products were strongly positioned to alleviate bottlenecks and digitize data flows across the health system.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well provided the capital in exchange for a convertible promissory note, which is a debt instrument that converts to equity and is issued when certain conditions outlined in the note are met. The new funding will be used to build out Phelix.ai’s solutions, grow the team, and expand across its channel partners. A channel partner is a company that typically markets and sells a manufacturer&#8217;s products. </p>
<p>Well also entered into a strategic alliance agreement with Phelix.ai, which grants Well the right to use and sublicense Phelix.ai&#8217;s clinical assistant automation software.</p>
<p>“Our focus has always been on relieving front line staff from the repetitive and burdensome tasks that plague most healthcare workflows,” said Hassaan Ahmed, CEO of Phelix AI. “The COVID-19 outbreak presented a unique set of challenges, and our suite of products were strongly positioned to alleviate bottlenecks and digitize data flows across the health system.”</p>
<p>Phelix.ai’s technology combines fax automation, call centre automation, booking automation, as well as two-way patient messaging and robust workflow analytics to create a virtual assistant. The startup’s conversational AI engine uses natural language understanding to triage and action administrative and clinical requests by phone, text, or a virtual website agent.</p>
<p>Phelix.ai is also able to schedule, connect, and auto-bill for secure phone visits, alongside in-person or video-based virtual care. No integration is required, and the entire service can be handled through a single phone line for each physician. The startup claims it can free up to 75 percent of time spent on workflow tasks, and therefore allows frontline healthcare workers to spend more time on patient care.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/akira-health-acquired-by-telus-health/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Akira Health acquired by Telus Health</a></strong></p>
<p>The startup recently launched a public health assistant tool that helps triage, follow-up with, and contact trace COVID-19 cases, allowing front line staff to focus on complex cases or clusters. Phelix’s Intake Assistant is deployed with diagnostic imaging providers across North America, and the company said it is being implemented to address surgical backlogs resulting from COVID-19 related suspensions of elective procedures.</p>
<p>Well Health is a public digital health company that operates primary healthcare facilities, which usually provide community care and home-care services.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vancouver-based AbCellera has closed a $144 million CAD ($105 million USD) Series B funding round to help further advance its antibody drug discovery platform.</p>
<p>The round was led by OrbiMed, a United States-based healthcare-focused fund, and current investor DCVC Bio, with an investor syndicate that included Viking Global Investors, Peter Thiel of Founders Fund, University of Minnesota, and Presight Capital. The round also saw participation from Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), an American pharmaceutical company that recently entered into a multi-year strategic research <a href="https://betakit.com/abcellera-partners-with-american-pharmaceutical-company-on-multi-year-antibody-discovery-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">partnership</a> and license agreement with AbCellera.</p>
<blockquote><p>AbCellera recently received a commitment of $175.6 million from the federal government under the Strategic Innovation Fund. </p></blockquote>
<p>Founded in 2012, AbCellera is a biotech company with a drug discovery platform that searches and analyzes immune systems to find antibodies that can be used to prevent and treat disease. The startup plans to use its newfound capital to &#8220;expand its capacity&#8221; and invest in technologies that &#8220;complement and extend&#8221; its antibody discovery platform.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this week, AbCellera announced the Lilly partnership, which will see the startup work to discover antibodies for nine therapeutic applications, of which Lilly will have the right to develop and commercialize any therapeutic products resulting from the research. According to The Globe and Mail, AbCellera has <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-vancouver-biotech-firm-abcellera-raises-us105-million-as-it-focuses/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">partnered</a> with several of the world’s largest drug companies to use its technology to help identify dozens of drug candidates for diseases.</p>
<p>According to the company, it has successfully completed more than 55 programs, delivering high-quality antibody drug candidates for a wide variety of drug targets. AbCellera also noted that it has generated &#8220;lead therapeutic antibody candidates&#8221; for various diseases including cancer, immuno-oncology, neurodegeneration, pain, fibrosis, and metabolic disorders.</p>

<p>The newly raised Series B and the partnership come just a few short weeks after AbCellera received a commitment of up to $175.6 million from the federal government under Innovation, Science, and Economic Development’s Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF). The funding was part of the government’s $192 million commitment to new COVID-19 projects that were prioritized under SIF. </p>
<p>AbCellera’s federal government funding was intended to help the company expand efforts to discover antibodies for use in drugs to treat COVID-19, as well as build therapy technology for future pandemic threats. In addition to the support from the Government of Canada, AbCellera received an undisclosed amount of funding from the City of Vancouver.</p>
<p>The $144 million Series B will also support the growth of AbCellera&#8217;s facilities and team. The biotech startup has plans to open a new 48,000-square-foot research and development facility in 2021. AbCellera is also building a manufacturing facility for the production of pharmaceutical drug products for clinical testing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.darwinai.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DarwinAI</a>, a Kitchener-Waterloo-based artificial intelligence startup, is partnering with global aerospace company <a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lockheed Martin</a> to improve Lockheed Martin’s customers’ understanding of AI solutions.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Negotiating AI’s black box problem in a practical, actionable manner is a key focus for us this year.”</p></blockquote>
<p>DarwinAI offers an explainability platform that attempts to describe how neural networks, which are complex constructions that mimic the human brain, reach their decisions. Lockheed Martin will use this platform to identify projects across its business where explainability technology can be applied.</p>
<p>“Explainability is a critical challenge in our industry,” said Lee Ritholtz, director and chief architect of applied artificial intelligence at Lockheed Martin. “Understanding how a neural network makes its decisions is important in constructing robust AI solutions that our customers can trust.”</p>
<p>According to a 2019 <a href="https://www.aeromontreal.ca/tude-aerospatiale-intelligence-articifielle.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from Aéro Montréal, the aerospace sector has many regulatory<br />
and safety concerns that can delay AI adoption. For example, developing an algorithm that can determine whether or not a device is “flightworthy,” requires a high level of explanation to engineers and regulators. The report said explainability is therefore a critical field of research in the aerospace industry.</p>
<p>DarwinAI has created an explainability platform for deep learning development powered by its technology, <a href="https://www.darwinai.com/features.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GenSynth Explain</a>. In addition to optimizing neural networks, the platform aims to dramatically reduce the time it takes to produce strong and accurate models.</p>
<p>This explainability problem is prevalent in but not limited to the aerospace industry. AI is often described as having a “<a href="http://artificialintelligencemania.com/2019/01/10/the-black-box-problem/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">black box problem</a>,” meaning like an airplane’s black box, it is difficult to explain what is going on internally, as the technology continues to advance.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/element-ai-to-implement-ai-features-into-japanese-automotive-companys-operations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Element AI to implement AI features into Japanese automotive company’s operations</a></strong></p>
<p>Founded in 2017, DarwinAI emerged out of stealth with <a href="https://betakit.com/darwinai-raises-3-9-million-cad-to-help-devs-design-neural-networks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$3.9 million CAD</a> in seed funding in September 2018. The company seeks to combat this black box problem, aiming to create explainable AI that allows enterprises to build AI models they can trust. </p>
<p>The founding team includes CEO Sheldon Fernandez, also a co-founder of software consultancy Infusion, which was <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/avanade-acquires-infusion-strengthening-its-digital-transformation-capabilities-and-leadership-in-microsoft-services-300414684.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired</a> by Avanade last year.DarwinAI’s founding team also includes chief scientist Alexander Wong, a professor at the University of Waterloo, and COO Arif Virani, a former McKinsey &#038; Company technology consultant. </p>
<p>“Negotiating AI’s black box problem in a practical, actionable manner is a key focus for us this year,” said Fernandez. “Our collaboration with a leader in the aerospace industry such as Lockheed Martin underscores the importance of trustworthy AI solutions. We look forward to this important collaboration.”</p>
<p>Darwin AI also recently <a href="https://betakit.com/darwinai-university-of-waterloo-develop-neural-network-for-covid-19-detection/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">co-developed</a> a neural network for COVID-19 detection via chest radiography with the University of Waterloo’s Vision and Image Processing Lab. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Medical Innovation Xchange (<a href="https://www.medicalinnovationxchange.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MIX</a>), a healthtech hub based in Kitchener-Waterloo, is partnering with the Government of Ontario to offer free advisory services to companies retooling their manufacturing facilities to create medical supplies in the fight against COVID-19.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are uniquely positioned to help domestic non-medical manufacturing companies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>MIX will provide its advisory services to the Ontario Together Fund recipients and companies that have received purchase orders from the province. The $50 million Ontario Together Fund was <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2020/04/ontario-joins-forces-with-the-private-sector-to-fight-covid-19.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched</a> in April to help businesses provide innovative solutions or retool their operations in order to manufacture essential medical supplies and equipment.</p>
<p>“MIX advisors currently help young domestic medical technology companies navigate the specific challenges in the healthcare sector,” said Armen Bakirtzian, CEO of Intellijoint Surgical and founder of MIX. “We are uniquely positioned to help domestic non-medical manufacturing companies facing similar challenges as they accelerate the production of medical equipment and supplies to meet both short-term and long-term demands.”</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/bookjane-repurposes-platform-to-help-ontario-medical-association-fight-covid-19/">BookJane repurposes platform to help Ontario Medical Association fight COVID-19</a></strong></p>
<p>Advisory services will be provided by MIX CEOs as well as the employees of their Canadian medical technology companies, some of which include <a href="https://www.intellijointsurgical.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Intellijoint Surgical</a>, <a href="https://www.venamed.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vena Medical</a>, <a href="https://pentavo.com/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Penta Medical</a>, and <a href="https://www.ne-rv.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NERv Technology</a>.</p>
<p>Areas of focus for advice include clinical research, device engineering, traceability, post-market surveillance, manufacturing, compliance, and Health Canada medical device licences. MIX will also facilitate connections within Canada to source product testing labs, consultants, testing, packaging compliance, and sterilization suppliers.</p>
<p>The concept for MIX was first announced <a href="https://betakit.com/intellijoint-surgical-to-lead-new-medtech-innovation-hub-in-waterloo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in June</a> by Bakirtzian, and officially launched <a href="https://betakit.com/medical-innovation-xchange-incubator-hub-officially-launches-in-kitchener-waterloo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in January</a>. MIX aims to offer healthtech companies an environment to grow locally and go to market globally. The organization says itit does not take equity in participating companies, as it is intended to be a “collision space” for peers and strategic advisors in the Waterloo Region.</p>
<p>On March 21, Premier Doug Ford launched the Ontario Together <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/how-your-organization-can-help-fight-coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">web portal</a> and asked Ontario manufacturers and entrepreneurs to provide essential supplies and equipment to support frontline workers in their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>More than 17,000 proposals have been submitted to the portal, and on May 6, the province announced Oakville, Ont.-based <a href="https://virox.com/making-news/virox-corp-news/ontario-funds-virox-technologies-inc-to-help-fight-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Virox Technologies</a> was the first manufacturer to receive money from the $50 million Ontario Together Fund.</p>
<p>“Through the Ontario Together initiative, we can support supply chains, ensure the growth of medical technologies in our province and ultimately, be better prepared for the future,” said Vic Fedeli, Ontario’s minister of economic development, job creation, and trade.</p>
<p>Canadian healthtech companies interested in offering volunteer services for this effort are also encouraged to contact MIX.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The British Columbia-based <a href="https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Technology Supercluster</a> has announced seven new projects that are part of its COVID-19 program, which is focused on unlocking solutions that protect the public health, safety, and the economy during and after the crisis.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Canada’s tech community has come together to find innovative solutions in the fight against COVID-19.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The seven new projects are part of a $60 million commitment from the Digital Technology Supercluster to projects that deliver solutions to health and safety problems created by the pandemic. Projects for this supercluster are focused on solutions such as handheld diagnosis devices and virtual health care services. </p>
<p>“I am happy to see how Canada’s tech community has come together to find innovative solutions in the fight against COVID-19 while leveraging technology to better prepare for future pandemics,” said Navdeep Bains, minister of innovation, science and industry.</p>
<p>In March, the federal government <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-government-refocuses-innovation-procurement-programs-in-fight-against-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">refocused</a> some of its innovation programs, including the Innovation Supercluster Initiative, to help in its fight against COVID-19. The Digital Technology Supercluster projects announced Tuesday are in addition to previously announced projects including the <a href="https://betakit.com/dnastack-launches-new-tool-to-help-scientists-share-genomic-data-on-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">COVID-19 Beacon</a> launched in March. </p>
<p>The funding amounts for these new projects were not disclosed. The new projects are: </p>
<p><strong>Point-of-Care Ultrasound for COVID-19:</strong> This project will use an ultrasound device to provide a diagnosis of patients with pneumonia potentially caused by COVID-19. This tool will initially focus on rural and remote communities and long-term care homes for seniors.</p>
<p><strong>Protecting Canadians by Predicting the Evolution of COVID-19:</strong> This project is bringing together researchers to forecast changes to the virus in order to pre-design tests, therapies, and vaccines to manage future outbreaks.</p>
<p><strong>Thunderbird:</strong> This project is developing an AI-powered platform to help identify treatments with new speed and effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>xrAI:</strong> Through this project, Vancouver-based startup 1QBit is using AI to identify lung abnormalities on chest x-rays in real-time, enabling clinicians in emergency rooms and rural hospitals to better identify COVID-19 and other lung-related illnesses.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/health-canada-expedites-approval-of-1qbit-chest-radiography-ai-tool-to-help-fight-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Health Canada expedites approval of 1QBit chest radiography AI tool to help fight COVID-19</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Improving ICU Capacity during COVID-19 Outbreaks:</strong> This project is developing software to enable hospitals to better manage and predict ICU capacity leading to better care and outcomes for patients.</p>
<p><strong>Providing Safe and Effective Home Care during COVID-19:</strong> This project is aimed to increase the functionality of startup AlayaCare’s existing digital toolkit and accelerate the delivery of <a href="https://www.alayacare.com/blog/alayacare-releases-covid19-screener" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">COVID-specific</a> features.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid Deployment of Emergency Case Management:</strong> This project will provide remote monitoring and virtual care, including rapid referral to required services.</p>
<p>Other superclusters across Canada have also been realigning their programs to meet the demands of the federal government during the crisis. The Scale AI Supercluster in Quebec announced several<a href="https://betakit.com/alayacare-dialogue-among-projects-receiving-3-4-million-from-scale-ai-supercluster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> new projects</a> under its own COVID-19 initiative this month, and the Oceans Supercluster in Atlantic Canada launched a <a href="https://betakit.com/ocean-supercluster-calling-for-projects-that-support-canadas-ocean-sector-during-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">call for projects</a> that build resilience in Canada’s ocean sector during the pandemic.</p>
<p>During the announcement of the new supercluster projects, Bains also discussed several new innovation-focused deals to procure ventilators and facemasks. General Motors will produce 10 million face masks while US company Vexos will help bring the country’s total number of ventilators to 40,000.</p>
<p>The Canadian government also signed letters of intent with six organizations to increase testing capacity. Bains said since launching its call to industry, 6,300 companies have contacted the government to offer expertise or capacity, and 700 have retooled to create personal protective equipment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://dmz.ryerson.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The DMZ</a> has partnered with the Town of Innisfil, Ontario to help scale tech startups and increase government procurement in the region through virtual programming and resources.</p>
<p>The program, called <a href="https://dmz.ryerson.ca/press-releases/town-of-innisfil-partners-with-dmz-to-scale-startups-and-increase-government-procurement/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DMZ Innisfil</a>, already has eight startups in its virtual incubator program. DMZ Innisfil will offer workshop curriculum, mentorship, a venture capital network, and will work to secure expedited government procurement to tech entrepreneurs within Innisfil. </p>
<blockquote><p>DMZ Innisfil already has eight startups in its virtual incubator program, and applications are open.</p></blockquote>
<p>“We’re so proud to partner with a world-leading tech startup accelerator like the DMZ,”<br />
said Mayor of Innisfil Lynn Dollin. “With 82 percent of Innisfil leaving town for work every day, and over 90 percent of new jobs being created by businesses less than five years old, we’re really focused on creating and supporting the jobs of tomorrow.”</p>
<p>This is not the first innovative initiative the Town of Innisfil has participated in. In 2017, the municipality <a href="https://betakit.com/innisfil-saved-73500-through-uber-public-transportation-partnership/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">teamed up</a> with Uber to pilot public transportation projects that saved the town $73,500. Last year, Innisfil also became the first municipality in Canada to accept cryptocurrency, <a href="https://betakit.com/coinberry-innisfil-partnership-makes-it-first-canadian-municipality-accepting-crypto/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">partnering</a> with crypto startup CoinBerry on a one-year pilot.</p>
<p>With some tech giants like Shopify moving to a <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-moving-vast-majority-of-employees-to-permanent-remote-work/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">permanent</a> remote work model, DMZ is looking to expand its virtual programming by partnering with municipalities to ensure that geographic location is not a factor when it comes to supporting tech startups. </p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/innovation-challenges-launched-to-help-southwestern-ontario-tech-rebuild-recover-from-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Innovation challenges launched to help southwestern Ontario tech rebuild, recover from COVID-19</a></strong></p>
<p>In April, the incubator also held an online <a href="https://betakit.com/dmz-launches-hackthecurve-to-help-develop-solutions-addressing-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hackathon</a> aimed at facilitating the development of solutions to help address the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>“Today, location isn’t stopping anyone from starting a business,” said Abdullah Snobar, executive director of the DMZ. “We are excited to partner with the Town of Innisfil to develop a new wave of scalable businesses that are proudly outside the traditional metropolitan areas for technology innovation.”</p>
<p>One of the startups participating in DMZ Innisfil is Reliant.to, a proptech company providing an automated solution for Toronto Building Compliance and Building Permits. Applications for the DMZ Innisfil program are currently open.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Top Hat is set to acquire the Canadian domestic higher education textbook businesses of Nelson Education, one of the country&#8217;s largest education publishers.</p>
<p>Through the acquisition, Top Hat is set to purchase more than 400 higher education textbook titles published by Nelson, which are reportedly used by 80 percent of Canadian institutions. The deal marks the publishing company, which was founded in 1914, moving out of the post-secondary market to focus solely on K-12.</p>
<blockquote><p>The acquisition will transform the Canadian higher education publishing landscape, said Top Hat.</p></blockquote>
<p>As an active learning platform for higher education, Top Hat plans to convert the currently print-only textbook titles into digital courseware on the Top Hat platform, and integrate them into the startup&#8217;s interactive offerings. The move signals a shift within the industry to online education.</p>
<p>According to Top Hat, the acquisition will transform the Canadian higher education publishing landscape, moving the company closer to its goal of being a leading player in the industry. The goal of disrupting the traditional print textbook market is a strategy Top Hat pursued following its <a href="https://betakit.com/top-hat-raises-72-million-cad-series-d-inks-deals-to-disrupt-the-textbook-industry/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$72 million CAD</a> Series D funding round, which was announced in February. At the time, Mike Silagadze, CEO and founder of Top Hat, told BetaKit he sees &#8220;ultimate success&#8221; as having Top Hat in every classroom in the world.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/top-hat-restructures-makes-staff-reductions-as-covid-19-affects-higher-education/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Top Hat restructures, makes staff reductions as COVID-19 affects higher education</a></strong></p>
<p>The Toronto-based startup planned to use part of its Series D funding to increase its partnerships with publishers and had recently entered into two such partnerships, inking deals to become the exclusive partner for postsecondary publishers Fountainhead Press and Bluedoor Publishing. Silagadze noted at the time that Top Hat had also been in talks with other publishers as well.</p>
<p>“[There is a] demise of the print publishing universe where their revenues are declining by double digits every year and they’re really struggling,” Silagadze told BetaKit in February. “Top Hat really is the solution to that, to help all publishers level the playing field and to have that interactive digital platform to deliver their courses.”</p>
<p>The news of the acquisition follows shortly after an <a href="https://betakit.com/top-hat-restructures-makes-staff-reductions-as-covid-19-affects-higher-education/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">internal restructuring</a> by Top Hat to adapt to changes in the higher education sector brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. The startup permanently laid off three percent (16 people) of its total headcount, shifting 28 employees from outbound sales roles in order to focus on digital content and enterprise institutional sales.</p>
<p>The changes came about due to Top Hat reporting difficulty in reaching its core customer base, professors, and, at the same time, witnessing tech adoption at the schools becoming more centralized at the administrative level.</p>
<p>Silagadze also expressed concern to BetaKit about changes COVID-19 may bring about for universities. A survey conducted by the startup found that seven percent of university students said they wouldn’t return to school in the Fall if the term would be online only, with Silagadze noting that because enrollment represents a big chunk of revenue for universities, this could lead to cost-cutting, which could, in turn, affect Top Hat.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/top-hat-launches-free-version-of-platform-as-universities-move-to-online-learning/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Top Hat launches free version of platform as universities move to online learning</a></strong></p>
<p>Top Hat expressed that its acquisition of Nelson&#8217;s post-secondary business can help educators facing uncertainty around the upcoming school year. &#8220;Educators who adopt these titles on the Top Hat platform will have the flexibility to deliver their courses effectively and motivate their students in any teaching environment, whether online or in-person, synchronous or asynchronous,&#8221; the company stated.</p>
<p>More than three million students are enrolled in courses using Top Hat, according to the company, at 750 of the top 1,000 higher education institutions in North America.</p>
<p>Nelson plans to &#8220;finalize&#8221; what it is calling its &#8220;withdrawal&#8221; from the post-secondary education market in the coming weeks. It plans to do so through collaboration with its existing publishing partners, as it concludes a &#8220;second strategic agreement with another key player in the field.&#8221; The publishers noted that Top Hat&#8217;s acquisition will allow post-secondary institutions to benefit from &#8220;uninterrupted warehouse ordering and a dedicated office presence to ensure a smooth transition.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://fsc-ccf.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Future Skills Centre</a>, a research organization based in Toronto, has launched a $15 million call for proposals for solutions that build resilience in the labour market during the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Future Skills Centre also recently launched a project supporting tourism and hospitality workers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The organization is <a href="https://fsc-ccf.ca/innovation-projects/#funding-calls" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seeking</a> proposals for activities such as research, network development, and innovation pilots that target sectors, regions, and populations currently facing urgent needs. Early or seed ideas can receive up to $25,000 investments, while large scale approaches with potential for exceptional impact can be funded up to $2.5 million.</p>
<p>“Skills development is an essential component of a strategy for post-pandemic recovery and building a better future for millions of Canadian workers,” said Pedro Barata, executive director of the Future Skills Centre. </p>
<p>“We are accelerating investments in groups, sectors, and regions where challenges are deepest and opportunities are emerging so we can support people now while learning lessons that can be scaled for future success,” he added.</p>
<p>Proposals should explore new insights and models within or across three levels of the labour market ecosystem: individuals, organizations, and system change. For individuals, solutions can help inform training and career development, particularly those who face barriers based on geography, background, or experience.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/future-skills-centre-investing-7-65-million-in-10-skills-development-projects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Future Skills Centre investing $7.65 million in 10 skills development projects</a></strong></p>
<p>Solutions that address organizations should offer opportunities for private and public entities to adopt new technologies and provide insights on health and safety, policy development, and program delivery. Finally, to address system change, solutions should promote innovative approaches to policy and program development. </p>
<p>Proposals will be accepted and reviewed on a continuous intake basis starting May 26 through to at least September 1.</p>
<p>This call for proposals follows the recent launch of Future Skills Centre’s first COVID-19-related project, which was a <a href="https://www.foodserviceandhospitality.com/new-rapid-response-project-to-support-tourism-and-hospitality-workers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2.25 million</a> partnership with Ontario Tourism Education Corporation. The organizations are working on a rapid response project to support displaced workers in the tourism and hospitality sector so they can navigate the current job market and develop new skills.</p>
<p>The Future Skills Centre is a research hub at Ryerson University and was initially launched in February 2019, tasked with funding projects related to skills development for workers. The centre is receiving <a href="https://theeyeopener.com/2019/02/ryerson-to-get-federally-funded-future-skills-centre/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$225 million</a> of federal funding over four years and $75 million thereafter to fulfill this mandate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toronto-based startup Cinchy has closed a $10 million CAD Series A funding round as it looks to help financial and healthcare sectors manage and collect data amid COVID-19.</p>
<p>Cinchy touts itself as a data collaboration company that has developed “the world’s first autonomous data fabric [technology].” Cinchy’s platform is designed to help organizations connect unlimited data sources within one “networked architecture.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“COVID is a good example where you could&#8230;literally improve patient outcomes and can help flatten curves.” </p></blockquote>
<p>The $10 million funding round was led by Information Venture Partners with participation from new investor Manulife Investment Management, as well as return investors BDC Capital, ScaleUp Ventures, and Techstars. </p>
<p>The raise brings Cinchy’s total funding to date to $13 million following a <a href="https://betakit.com/today-in-funding-16m-cinchy-twentybn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$3 million round</a> in late 2018.</p>
<p>“The driving force behind [Cinchy] is giving people control of their data,” Dan DeMers, Cinchy’s co-founder and CEO, told BetaKit. “The path to doing that is to enable big enterprise organizations to save hundreds of billions of dollars, by getting a handle on the data that they&#8217;re keeping as a custodian on your behalf. But ultimately, what it enables, for them and for you, is to get control over that data.”</p>
<p>Cinchy’s data fabric platform is built on the idea of making it easier and more secure to access data all in one location. Rather than organizations having to transfer or copy data in order to share it, Cinchy’s platform allows multiple users to access one common data source, while keeping that information secure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cinchy is already a proven platform that is adopted by some of the largest financial institutions in the world to deliver complex enterprise projects while saving half the time and cost,” said David Unsworth, general partner at Information Venture Partners.</p>
<p>Amid COVID-19, healthcare agencies and governments have experienced a heightened need to easily, quickly, and securely share information, whether it&#8217;s to citizens or with other, third-party organizations. </p>
<p>As economies begin to open back up, <a href="https://betakit.com/group-of-shopify-volunteers-create-free-covid-19-contact-tracing-app/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contact tracing</a>, the practice of tracking people who may have come in contact with an infected person, has been a growing topic of discussion. Tracing allows governments and healthcare agencies to track the virus and allows people to get tested and isolate if they have been in contact with another infected person. The Government of Canada is currently <a href="https://betakit.com/group-of-shopify-volunteers-create-free-covid-19-contact-tracing-app/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in talks</a> with a number of different partners, including Apple and Google, on building out a contract tracing app for the country.</p>
<p>Cinchy has pitched its platform to the federal government and the <a href="https://thelogic.co/news/cinchy-wants-to-create-a-covid-19-data-command-centre-for-canadas-health-agencies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ontario government</a> as a system that could help public health agencies use data from contact tracing solutions securely.</p>
<p>DeMers told BetaKit he sees this as an opportunity for Cinchy to be a “data collaboration command center.”</p>

<p>“That idea of a command center, had that been in place pre-pandemic [it], would have enabled rapid delivery of things like contact tracing and all these other capabilities,” he said. “Why our platform just makes sense in that COVID reality is you need to deliver things a lot faster &#8230;  there&#8217;s a sudden need to do everything digitally.” </p>
<p>The “command centre”, according to Cinchy, could collect any information from contact tracing data to inventory at hospitals, and help build systems that could alert healthcare agencies to equipment shortages or a spike in COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>DeMers told BetaKit that talks between Cinchy and government agencies are still ongoing, but he sees an opportunity for Cinchy to be more than just applicable to the healthcare system.</p>

<p>Cinchy’s expansion into the healthcare vertical is a new one. Founded in 2016, the startup previously focused on selling its platform to the financial services sector. DeMers’ background includes having spent over a decade at Citigroup, with Cinchy’s co-founder and CTO Karan Jaswal doing stints at both Citi and RBC Capital Markets. Because of this, Cinchy was designed specifically to handle the highly regulated, sensitive, and complex nature of financial systems.</p>
<p>“The control requirements are one of the reasons why organizations have challenges breaking into [financial services and healthcare],” Jaswal told BetaKit. “But that is actually what Cinchy does really, really well.”</p>
<p>Cinchy started by focusing on the financial sector but always had plans to expand, DeMers said, noting, “if it works for a bank it can work for a startup.” The CEO told BetaKit Cinchy had been working on a go-to-market strategy for its healthcare offering before COVID-19, and the pandemic simply helped to accelerate that move.</p>

<p>“COVID is a good example where you could see how faster delivery of technology can literally improve patient outcomes and can help flatten curves and have a major impact, hence the expansion,” he said. “This whole scenario is definitely opening new opportunities.”</p>
<p>Amid COVID-19, Cinchy worked with existing customer Concentra, a wholesale bank and trust company for Canadian credit unions, to develop a COVID-19 relief loan solution. Using Cinchy’s technology, Concentra was able to create a single platform that helped 35 credit unions distribute the Canada Emergency Business Account’s $40,000 small business loans.</p>
<p>Cinchy plans to use this latest funding round to meet what DeMers called “the growing demand for data fabric technology.” The startup, which currently sits at a team of 38, plans to grow its employee base across departments.</p>
<p>DeMers also has his sights on expanding Cinchy into other regions and sectors. “We&#8217;re scratching the surface in terms of the possibilities,” he said.</p>
<p>“The dramatic IT acceleration, data autonomy, and cost savings experienced by our customers and partners are proving that industry analysts were right,” said Jaswal. “Data Fabric technology is more than just the hottest trend, it is the beginning of a revolution.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook Canada is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/boost/grants" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offering</a> $3.5 million in grants, virtual training programs, and product features aimed to support Canadian small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The donations are part of a global initiative from the social media company that is making a total of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/coronavirus-update-news-industry-support" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$100 million</a> available to 30,000 businesses in 30 countries. </p>
<blockquote><p>“These grants will provide meaningful and timely support for entrepreneurs.”<br />
&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Between May 26 and June 2, Canadian small business owners can apply for grants of more than $5,000 in cash and ad credits. The grants are available for approximately 650 small businesses in cities where Facebook has offices: Toronto, Ottawa-Gatineau, Montreal, and Vancouver. Businesses do not need to have a presence on Facebook in order to apply. </p>
<p>“We know small businesses are being hit hard right now, and we want to help,” said Garrick Tiplady, managing director of Facebook and Instagram Canada. “We’re listening to the challenges Canadian small business owners face and want to do all we can to provide useful resources, including much needed financial support &#8230; during this challenging time.”</p>
<p>To be <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/boost/grants" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eligible</a>, businesses must have between two and 50 employees, have been in business for over a year, and experienced challenges from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Recently, Facebook <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-partners-with-facebook-to-launch-facebook-shops/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">partnered</a> with Canadian e-commerce company Shopify to launch Facebook Shops. The new feature allows Shopify merchants to control customization and merchandising for their storefronts inside Facebook and Instagram while managing their products, inventory, orders, and fulfillment directly from within Shopify.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-partners-with-facebook-to-launch-facebook-shops/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shopify partners with Facebook to launch Facebook Shops</a></strong></p>
<p> Starting this June, Facebook Canada will also run a free virtual training series in partnership with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce’s business resilience <a href="https://www.canadianbusinessresiliencenetwork.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">network</a>, to help reduce the hurdles businesses face when going online. The first session is on June 3.</p>
<p>Small business owners can also join the Boost with Facebook Canada group to access advice, and visit Facebook’s business <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/resource?ref=alias" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resource hub</a>, which offers information, virtual training, and resources.</p>
<p>Facebook has also expanded its personal fundraiser <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/personal_fundraisers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">policy</a> to give individuals the ability to fundraise for COVID-affected local businesses. Business owners can create a personal fundraiser on Facebook for their business and ask customers for support. Businesses can also now share gift card, food order, and fundraiser stickers in Instagram Stories and on their profiles.</p>
<p>Facebook’s advisory council is also expected to provide Facebook with local insights and expertise as the grant program rolls out. The council includes individuals from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and the regional boards of trade from Toronto, Ottawa, Gatineau, and Vancouver.</p>
<p>“Small businesses are the backbone of the economy, and they are doing their best to manage through the pandemic,” said Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade. “These grants will provide meaningful and timely support for entrepreneurs to accelerate digital transformation and economic recovery.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has extended two of the tax filing deadlines for corporations and trusts to September 1, due to the COVID-19...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CRA</a>) has extended two of the tax filing deadlines for corporations and trusts to September 1, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The agency said it made this decision to ease the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on Canadian businesses and tax preparers. The extensions, which are for the T2 and T3 statements, are in addition to the individual income tax return extension for Canadians. Penalties and interest will not be charged if payments are made by September 1.</p>
<blockquote><p>The CRA is also encouraging businesses to register for direct deposit.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CRA will allow businesses to defer T2 corporation income tax returns otherwise due in June, July or August, to September 1. Any income tax balance due on or after March 18 and before September 1 will also be due by September 1.</p>
<p>The deadlines for T3 trust returns that would otherwise be due in June, July or August, have been extended to September 1, 2020. Any income tax balance due on or after March 18 and before September 1 will also be due by September 1.</p>
<p>These new extensions are among several changes the agency has undertaken during the pandemic. In March, the CRA pushed back the filing date for individuals from April 30 to  June 1. For trusts with a taxation year ending on December 31, 2019, the due date for filing returns was moved back to May 1.</p>
<p>The CRA <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2020/03/canadas-covid-19-economic-response-plan-support-for-canadians-and-businesses.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> in April that it is also not contacting small and medium-sized businesses to initiate any post-assessment income tax audits until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/sred-claims-beginning-to-flow-after-initial-delay-caused-by-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SR&#038;ED payments beginning to flow to Canadian tech following delay caused by COVID-19</a></strong></p>
<p>The agency is also facilitating some of the federal government’s business relief programs, including the 75 percent <a href="https://betakit.com/here-are-the-final-details-on-the-canada-emergency-wage-subsidy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy</a>, which is available for private corporations, non‑profit organizations, and registered charities. The subsidy covers 75 percent of employee wages for up to 24 weeks and is retroactive from March 15 to August 29.</p>
<p>Businesses can register for <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/business-account.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">My Business Account</a> to view and manage their business&#8217; tax affairs. Businesses can also sign up for email notifications to receive CRA mail electronically, such as notices of assessment or reassessment, statements of account for current source deductions, and most statements and letters. </p>
<p>In order to avoid delays in payment delivery, the CRA is also encouraging businesses to sign up for <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html?utm_source=stkhldrs&#038;utm_medium=eml&#038;utm_campaign=cwstlcnfrncmy153" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">direct deposit</a> through their financial institutions. To be eligible to enroll for CRA direct deposit, organizations must have a valid business number and have a CRA program account for either payroll, GST or HST, or corporate income tax.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vancouver-based biotechnology firm <a href="https://www.abcellera.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AbCellera</a> has entered into a multi-year strategic research partnership and license agreement with American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company (<a href="http://www.lilly.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lilly</a>). </p>
<p>The partnership will see AbCellera work to discover antibodies for nine therapeutic applications. Lilly will have the right to develop and commercialize any therapeutic products resulting from the research.</p>
<blockquote><p>AbCellera recently received a commitment of up to $175.6 million from the Strategic Innovation Fund.</p></blockquote>
<p>AbCellera said it was <a href="https://www.abcellera.com/news/2020-03-abcellera-and-lilly-codevelopment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in talks</a> with Lilly about a similar agreement in early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged. The companies refocused the scope of the collaboration on creating antibody therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. In addition to the COVID-19 therapy, Lilly will select up to eight more targets during the agreement.</p>
<p>“By working together seamlessly, our teams have moved with unprecedented speed and have advanced from antibody discovery to a lead candidate for human testing in months instead of years,” said Carl Hansen, CEO of AbCellera. “We look forward to expanding our collaboration with Lilly, working together to continue to redefine how antibody treatments reach the patients who need them.”</p>
<p>The partnership comes a few weeks after AbCellera received a commitment of up to <a href="https://www.abcellera.com/news/2020-05-03" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$175.6 million</a> from the federal government under Innovation, Science, and Economic Development’s Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF). The funding was part of the government’s <a href="https://betakit.com/canada-commits-192-million-to-covid-19-sif-stream-signs-deal-with-bluedot-to-help-track-make-decisions-on-virus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$192 million</a> commitment to new COVID-19 projects that were prioritized under SIF.</p>

<p>AbCellera’s federal government funding was intended to help the company expand efforts to discover antibodies for use in drugs to treat COVID-19, as well as build therapy technology for future pandemic threats. In addition to the support from the Government of Canada, AbCellera received an undisclosed amount of funding from the City of Vancouver.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, AbCellera uses high-powered computers, artificial intelligence, and advanced lab technology to scan blood samples of patients who have recovered from COVID-19, and find antibodies from them that could be used in the treatment and prevention of the virus.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement with Lilly, AbCellera received an undisclosed upfront payment and will receive research payments for the non-COVID-19 therapeutic targets. AbCellera is also eligible to receive pre-clinical, clinical, and commercial milestones and tiered royalties on future sales.</p>
<p>“Lilly chose to partner with AbCellera because of [its] novel technology platform, and it has enabled the rapid identification of lead antibody candidates for our COVID-19 efforts. We’re excited to now apply it to other therapeutic targets,” said Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly’s chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “AbCellera’s capabilities and team are extremely impressive and we are proud of the progress we’ve made together thus far.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been two weeks since our last episode, and there’s a reason for that.</p>
<p>Black Swan was launched shortly after the pandemic hit, as a rapid-response to the emergency Canadian tech found itself in. More than two months later, the emergency has evolved into reality.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;How do we not lose the last decade of investment into the ecosystem?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite nascent attempts at ‘re-opening’ across Canada (and we’ll see how long they last), the impact of COVID-19 on Canadian tech and innovation won’t be subsiding any time soon. That requires a different approach to storytelling. One a little less reactive, and more proactive. Exploratory.</p>
<p>Like today’s episode, where we look at how different tech ecosystems across Canada are working to keep their ecosystem together.</p>
<p>Our first guest is Terry Rock, President and CEO of Platform Calgary, which is a member of the Alberta Innovation Corridor.</p>
<p>Like the rest of Canada, tech companies within the Corridor have been hit hard. But also at a weird time &#8211; Alberta was just beginning to set the roots of its ecosystem, culminating in the opening of its own Hub, the Platform Innovation Centre, in 2021. Other Corridor members like <a href="https://betakit.com/innovate-edmonton-loses-vp-director-of-strategy-as-edmonton-economic-development-corporation-makes-covid-19-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Innovate Edmonton</a> have been rocked with executive departures while the city’s government decides it needs a <a href="https://betakit.com/city-of-edmonton-approves-new-innovation-entity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">different innovation entity</a>.</p>
<p>We talk to Rock about all of this, and why he still believes Platform will be the hub Alberta tech needs a year from now.</p>
<p>The City of Toronto is hoping to sustain the investments it has made in the local tech ecosystem over the last decade. To do that, Toronto has tapped Chris Ricket, Director of Municipal and Stakeholder Relations at MPAC, but also the Director of COVID-19 Business Mitigation and Recovery, a role he was <a href="https://betakit.com/city-of-toronto-reclaims-startup-lead-as-it-restructures-to-better-fight-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seconded to</a> following his departure from the City last year.</p>
<p>In Toronto circles, Rickett is known as the guy tech companies go to if they want to work with the City. We ask him about exactly what role a municipal government can play in mitigating the economic bleeding, and the major recent departures of <a href="https://betakit.com/board-communicated-shutdown-decision-to-oneeleven-executive-director/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OneEleven</a> and <a href="https://betakit.com/sidewalk-labs-announces-it-will-no-longer-pursue-quayside-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sidewalk Labs</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://collisionconf.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Collision from Home</a> has announced that Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), will speak at this year’s virtual conference. Tedros is an Ethiopian microbiologist and malaria researcher who has served in his role at the WHO since 2017.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are relying on everyone in the field, from world leaders in medicine to the nurses on the frontline.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ghebreyesus is expected to speak about the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of the WHO. Collision from Home’s organizers intend to put a particular focus on healthcare for this year’s event, specifically on how the tech industry is accelerating solutions and addressing challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>“We’re incredibly humbled to welcome [Adhanom], one of the most important people in the world right now, to Collision from Home,” said Paddy Cosgrave, founder and CEO of Collision from Home. “This global pandemic has created a warlike scenario where the health industry is in an arms race, except the arms are not weapons, they are medical advancements that will save lives, such as tracking systems for contact tracing, and super fast testing.”</p>
<p>In addition to Ghebreyesus, speakers expected to focus on the pandemic response include Patrice Harris, president of the American Medical Association, Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis, and Leana Wen, visiting professor of health policy and management of George Washington University.</p>
<p>Startups that are expected to speak at Collision from Home, such as Austin, Texas-based <a href="https://www.everlywell.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Everlywell</a>, are also playing a role in the pandemic recovery. Everlywell, which was also <a href="https://betakit.com/singularity-university-to-host-three-day-virtual-summit-on-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">featured</a> in Singularity University’s virtual summit on COVID-19 in March, recently <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-standalone-home-sample-collection-kit-can-be-used" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">secured</a> authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to launch self-administered, at-home COVID-19 testing kits.</p>

<p>“We are desperate to return to any kind of ‘normal’ and now more than ever, we are relying on everyone in the field, from world leaders in medicine to the nurses on the frontline,” Cosgrave added. “I believe the tech advancements we’ll make over the next year and into 2021 will be incredible, and change the way healthcare is run forever.”</p>
<p>Since the in-person portion of Collision was <a href="https://betakit.com/collision-cancels-2020-in-person-conference-over-covid-19-fears/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancelled</a> earlier this year due to the pandemic, the organizers have brought on speakers that address a wide array of issues pertaining to the COVID-19 crisis. NBA All-Star champion turned investor <a href="https://betakit.com/shaquille-oneal-joins-speakers-set-to-headline-collision-from-home/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shaquille O&#8217;Neal</a>, for example, will be speaking at the 2020 virtual tech conference about unemployment. </p>
<p>Startups, speakers, investors, partners, and attendees will be able to access networking and content experiences through the Collision from Home app. The conference is expected to return to Toronto as a physical event from June 21 to 24, 2021, at the Enercare Centre.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FinTech startup <a href="https://www.koho.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Koho</a> is partnering with staffing startup <a href="https://hyr.work/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hyr</a>, which provides in-app staffing solutions to employers, to give Hyr users early access to their paycheque and government payments at no cost to the user.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re glad to be able to provide Hyr users with the buffer they may need&#8230; in a time of financial strain.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Daniel Eberhard</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Through the partnership, Hyr users are able to receive their paycheques directly to their Koho account. After making an initial direct deposit in their Koho account, users will be eligible to access $100 of their pay early and at no cost or interest. Users will have early access to direct deposits that can include government payments like The <a href="https://betakit.com/federal-82-billion-covid-19-emergency-response-package-to-support-businesses-workers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canada Emergency Response Benefit</a> as well as employment insurance.</p>
<p>“It’s always been our aim to deliver transparent and intuitive financial products to Canadians,” explains Daniel Eberhard, founder and CEO at Koho. “Now, we’re glad to be able to provide Hyr users with the buffer they may need to make purchases or payments in a time of financial strain, without having to resort to harmful loans or going further into debt.”</p>
<p>Koho offers a full-service chequing account that comes with a reloadable prepaid Visa card and integrated app. The startup is looking to disrupt the Canadian banking system and is backed by Portag3 Ventures, as well as Power Financial Corporation, which has invested in other alternative FinTech services including Wealthsimple, Borrowell, and League. </p>
<p>In response to COVID-19, Koho has <a href="https://help.koho.ca/en/articles/3854053-how-to-set-up-cra-direct-deposit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">streamlined</a> its sign-up process for users seeking benefits from the Canada Revenue Agency. Eberhard told BetaKit “hundreds” of people signed up in the first hour and over 1,000 people on the first day. The company is also looking to get people partial early access to CRA benefits. This feature is expected to be launched in early May.</p>

<p>In November, Koho raised an additional <a href="https://betakit.com/koho-adds-national-bank-and-drive-as-investors-with-25-million-cad-series-b-extension/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$25 million</a> in capital for its Series B, just six months after the initial close of the round at <a href="https://betakit.com/koho-raises-42-million-series-b-inside-round-led-by-portag3-ventures/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$42 million</a>.</p>
<p>Hyr’s staffing platform allows restaurants and retailers to connect with skilled and experienced gig workers that can fill hourly paid shifts on demand. Gig workers looking for extra money can look through postings that include pay rates, location, and include their desired schedule, while restaurants can post listings and view profiles of potential candidates. The company raised a <a href="https://betakit.com/hyr-raises-1-6-million-to-help-retailers-embrace-the-gig-economy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$1.5 million</a> seed round in 2018.</p>
<p>As part of its COVID-19 <a href="https://betakit.com/heres-how-cdntech-companies-are-pitching-in-during-the-covid-19-outbreak/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">response</a>, Hyr has expanded and repurposed its platform so that any non-profit or government organization can use Hyr for free to fill vital volunteer shifts. The app now helps connect willing volunteers who sign up on their platform to these positions. </p>
<p>Hyr is also helping connect displaced workers to essential service industries. Companies like Loblaws, Walmart, and Amazon, can now post and fill job opportunities on the platform for free.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled that two Canadian companies have come together to form this great solution for our users,” echoed Joshua Karam, Co-Founder and CEO of Hyr. “Together we’re working to support Canadians when it matters most and help reduce people’s reliance on payday loans.”</p>
<p><em>Update (27/05/2020):</em></p>
<p>Koho is now broadly piloting its early payroll feature to help users that are under financial strain pay their bills. The pilot will grant users free access to $100 of their CERB payment three days before the scheduled payday, and Koho will not charge fees or interest. A Koho spokesperson confirmed this is a broader version of the features launched with Hyr.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Government of Canada has launched a new hotline service to provide small businesses with financial planning and advice on COVID-19 recovery.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the new service on Monday. The Businesses Resilience Service, as it is called, is available starting today. </p>
<p>A government spokesperson told BetaKit that the idea behind the offering is to provide support for &#8220;the smallest and most vulnerable business owners, particularly those who may not have access to an accountant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Business Resilience Service will be available over the next four weeks and is run by advisors who can provide tailored financial advice to entrepreneurs, with the goal of helping them weather and recover from COVID-19.</p>
<p>The hotline is run in partnership with The Canadian Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Minister of Small Businesses Mary Ng is set to provide more detail on the hotline later today.</p>
<p>The Government of Canada has implemented a number of measures for businesses as part of its COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. The measures, backed with federal funding, include the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (applications opened today), wage subsidies including the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and a 10 percent wage subsidy, loans through the Business Credit Availability Program, the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund, and more.</p>
<p>The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has also partnered with Salesforce to launch the Canadian Business Resilience Network Small Business Relief Fund to offer $10,000 grants to 62 small Canadian businesses. The idea behind the fund is to help those businesses recover from the COVID-19 downturn.</p>
<p>The grants will be available to small, for-profit businesses that have been operating for several years and are experiencing challenges because of COVID-19. The application period will open on June 1 and close on June 12.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Applications for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) opened today, allowing landlords to apply to the federal government&#8217;s relief program.</p>
<p>The CECRA is meant to help small businesses maintain rent payments, as many small businesses across the country have been hard hit by the effects of the current global pandemic. The now-open application portal is accessible through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), which is responsible for administering the rent relief program.</p>
<p>The program was announced mid-April and is meant to help lower rent for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) affected by COVID-19. The CECRA allows SMBs to pay just 25 percent of their monthly rent, with governments and property owners absorbing the other 75 percent. </p>
<p>Eligible commercial property owners are being offered unsecured, forgivable loans in order to allow them to reduce rent and help them meet operating expenses on commercial properties. Property owners are required to offer a minimum of a 75 percent rent reduction for the months of April, May, and June, retroactively. Small business tenants that have been impacted by COVID-19 and are paying less than $50,000 per month in gross rent, with annual revenues of less than $20 million, are eligible for the program. The tenants must have experienced at least a 70 percent drop in pre-COVID-19 revenues.</p>
<p>Last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government is working on a rent relief program for larger companies, with details set to be shared “soon.”</p>
<p>More details on the CECRA are expected later today.</p>
<p>According to the CMHC it is expecting “a large volume of applications” for the rent relief program and to manage the volume has asked property owners to apply on specific days. Registration is broken down by province. </p>
<p>As of Monday, property owners located in Atlantic Canada, British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec, with up to 10 tenants that are eligible for the program, can apply. Property owners in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Ontario (also with up to 10 eligible tenants) can apply Tuesday. The applications open up to all property owners in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and the Territories, as of Wednesday, followed by Atlantic Canada, British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec on Thursday.</p>
<p>More details on the CECRA can be found <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/finance-and-investing/covid19-cecra-small-business" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. The deadline to apply is August 31.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toronto-based e-commerce startup <a href="https://www.emerge-commerce.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Emerge Commerce</a> has announced plans to go public on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) following a planned acquisition of Aumento, a public capital pool company.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We prefer profitable, steady growth, rather than ‘growth at all costs’, as unsexy as that may sound.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Emerge has signed a letter of intent to acquire Aumento through a reverse takeover, and the proceeds will mostly go towards upcoming acquisitions as well as growth capital. A reverse takeover is the acquisition of a public company by a private company so that the private company can bypass the lengthy and complex process of going public. </p>
<p>As part of the letter of intent, Emerge is raising a $5 million private placement led by Canaccord Genuity and Gravitas, which is expected to close later this week. Emerge expects to complete its agreement with Aumento over the next month. The company also expects to receive TSXV approval to list within 30 to 60 days. CEO Ghassan Halazon claimed the definitive agreement with Aumento will give Emerge a pre-money valuation of $45 million CAD. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are in the fortunate position to take EMERGE public during these extraordinary times, in large part due to the strong performance of our COVID-resilient portfolio of e-commerce assets,” Halazon told BetaKit.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/lightspeed-sees-record-uptake-amid-covid-19-despite-concerns-over-reduced-demand/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lightspeed sees record uptake amid COVID-19 despite concerns over reduced demand</a></strong> </p>
<p>&#8220;E-commerce is seeing more growth over the last couple of months than it has over the last 10 years,” he added. “As an acquirer and operator of e-commerce assets, we believe going public will assist and accelerate our profitable [merger and acquisition] consolidation strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Emerge has developed an e-commerce network by acquiring and operating niche market leaders in the digital deals space across North America. The company operates in a variety of categories, including groceries, essentials, golf, online subscriptions, retailer coupons and experiences, among other categories. </p>
<p>Emerge brands include <a href="https://www.underpar.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UnderPar</a>, <a href="https://www.wagjag.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WagJag</a>, <a href="https://justgolfstuff.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">JustGolfStuff</a>, <a href="https://buytopia.ca/landing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Buytopia</a>, and <a href="https://www.shop.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shop.ca</a>. Through its network, Emerge currently connects 2.3 million people with 12,000 merchants across North America.</p>
<p>“In the company’s first three years of existence, our primary focus was on acquiring distressed digital deals brands with proven e-commerce customer databases at very attractive prices, really pennies on the dollar,” said Halazon.</p>
<p>After consolidating companies in the small-to-mid-market e-commerce landscape, Halazon said its early success allowed Emerge to start acquiring niche market leaders in the broader digital deals and savings space that come with a “proven track record of growth and profitability.” It <a href="https://betakit.com/emerge-commerce-purchases-underpar-group-for-12-million-in-largest-acquisition-to-date/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired</a> UnderPar for $12 million in November. </p>
<p>To date, Emerge has largely relied on founders and entrepreneurs, family offices, and Bay Street executives to raise capital. It has worked closely with wealth management firm Gravitas as its banking partner. Clearbanc founder Michele Romanow is Emerge’s shareholder and serves as an advisor. CEO of Indochino, Drew Green, is Emerge’s chairman. </p>
<p>The company has intentionally avoided venture capital, Halazon said,  partly because the team wanted to maintain a “straightforward cap table.”</p>

<p>“More importantly, we simply do not subscribe to the Silicon Valley driven ‘Scale or Die’ mantra, which is to say we prefer profitable, steady growth, rather than ‘growth at all costs’, as unsexy as that may sound,” the CEO told BetaKit. </p>
<p>Halazon noted how the COVID-19 pandemic has helped e-commerce reach new heights. Golf was one of the first sectors allowed to reopen in Canadian provinces as COVID-19 restrictions were relaxed, and Halazon told BetaKit that Emerge sold $100,000 in golf-related products on the day of the announcement.</p>
<p>“Online shopping has been a clear winner and Emerge has been fortunate enough to be in a position to draw on its diversified portfolio, quickly repurposing virtual shelves to match consumer demands,” said Halazon.</p>
<p>The CEO said the current plan is to complete another two acquisitions in 2020 with the plan of arriving at more than $10 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization over the next 12 to 18 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many Canadian startups have faced challenges of late due to the economic impacts of COVID-19. Receipt management app <a href="https://getsensibill.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sensibill</a> is one such startup, dealing with both restructuring and growth opportunities during the pandemic.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sensbill acknowledged that the restructuring plan was made “in the wake of COVID-19”</p></blockquote>
<p>Sensibill has laid off a significant number of employees, BetaKit has learned. A source speaking with BetaKit said the layoffs took place on April 1 and represent approximately one-fifth of the company’s overall workforce, or 17 employees. Postings on the company’s Glassdoor page put the number at 18.</p>
<p>At the time, Sensibill declined to confirm with BetaKit the exact number of employees laid off. “Like many businesses, we’ve had to make some tough calls in recent weeks. In the wake of COVID-19, Sensibill announced a restructuring plan in April,” the company told BetaKit in a statement.</p>
<p>Sensibill has also declined to answer repeated requests for more information on the company’s restructuring plan, or which departments were affected. The company also did not confirm to BetaKit whether any current plans or projects are being impacted by the pandemic. </p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/intersect-ceo-departs-company-following-recent-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Intersect CEO departs company following recent layoffs</a></strong></p>
<p>In a response to Glassdoor reviews referencing the layoffs, Sensbill acknowledged that the restructuring plan was made “in the wake of COVID-19” and was communicated to the company the same day and to “peer networks in the Toronto tech ecosystem” within one week. </p>
<p>“The restructuring has resulted in some areas of the business continuing to hire to fill talent needs, while in other areas, there were a lot of good people who we had to let go,” the Sensibill post reads. </p>
<p>“We are continuously evaluating where we most need additional talent to support any adjustments to our strategic direction,” the company added.</p>
<p>According to its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/careersite/sensibill" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, Sensibill is currently hiring in four roles, two in business development, one in IT, and one administrative position. The company said on Glassdoor it is hiring slower than it had forecast at the start of the year due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Sources who spoke to BetaKit indicated that Sensibill at the time made no announcement regarding the layoffs. One review posted on Glassdoor on May 8 appears to corroborate the claim. </p>
<p>“Everyone within the company and who were let go are left confused because no one told anyone who was let go,” the review reads. </p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/report-one-quarter-of-canadian-startups-have-made-layoffs-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One-quarter of Canadian startups have made layoffs amid COVID-19</a></strong></p>
<p>Following the layoffs, Sensibill has secured $5 million in debt financing from <a href="https://www.cibc.com/en/commercial/areas-of-specialization/innovation-banking.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CIBC Innovation Banking</a>. It is unlikely that the funding is tied to the layoffs, as CIBC Innovation Banking commonly does not fund bail-outs, only growth ventures. A media release issued by CIBC Innovation Banking affirmed that the financing was growth capital. </p>
<p>Sensibill also declined to offer BetaKit any comment related to the new funding, and did not confirm whether the company was looking to use any currently available government relief programs.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Sensibill’s software uses machine learning to identify and extract unstructured text from receipts and return structured data in the form of a digital receipt. The technology allows banks and credit unions to provide their customers, better integrated financial management.  </p>
<p>The company has forged several banking partnerships both domestically and internationally, including United Kingdom-based Metro Bank and Scotiabank. Sensibill is backed by Radical Ventures, Information Venture Partners, First Ascent Ventures, and Impression Ventures, and raised a <a href="https://betakit.com/receipt-management-startup-sensibill-raises-41-million-cad-series-b/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$41 million CAD</a> ($31.5 million USD) Series B in July of last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jon French, who has long held a senior leadership position at NEXT Canada, has departed his role with the Toronto-based accelerator. French is now the director for University of Toronto Entrepreneurship.</p>
<blockquote><p>“His contributions are hard to quantify and he will be greatly missed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>French leaves NEXT Canada after more than nine years with the organization, where he most recently served as senior director of global recruitment, community, and alumni. French held various roles at the accelerator over the years, including leading NEXT Canada’s marketing and communications.</p>
<p>BetaKit recently sat down (virtually) with French to discuss his time at NEXT Canada, his new role at the University of Toronto, and his thoughts on how COVID-19 will affect Canadian startups and the accelerators that support them.</p>
<p>NEXT Canada was founded in 2010 as The Next 36 by a group of business leaders and academics. French joined NEXT Canada during its early days as one of the first full-time hires for the young organization. Today, the national non-profit offers three accelerator streams, NextAI, Next 36, and Next Founders.</p>
<p>French was heavily involved in recruiting talent to NEXT Canada’s accelerator programs, worked with program alumni, and helped to expand NextAI to Montreal.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/11-startups-to-pitch-at-next-canadas-virtual-venture-reveal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">11 startups to pitch at NEXT Canada’s virtual Venture Reveal</a></strong></p>
<p>Jenn Patterson, chief marketing officer at NEXT Canada, called French “instrumental” in recruiting and “changing the trajectory of some of Canada’s most talented entrepreneurs.”</p>
<p>“His contributions are hard to quantify and he will be greatly missed,” she told BetaKit.</p>
<p>For his part, French told BetaKit, “[It] got to a point after the last six months to a year where I feel like the organization is in a great place. There&#8217;s a good leadership group there. I&#8217;ve achieved a lot of what I wanted to achieve and started looking for new challenges.”</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There’s no doubt that there will be tough times and tough decisions that need to be made for a number of accelerators and incubators across the country.”<br />
<em> &#8211; Jon French</em><br />
&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>While at NEXT Canada, to help recruit startups for its programs, French was responsible for building relationships with universities and startup communities across Canada. He told BetaKit his new role with the University of Toronto is like being on the other side of that process, calling it “synergistic.”</p>
<p>“[I’m] being the glue, the advocate, the champion for the different accelerator and incubator programs at UofT and advocating for them and helping them get funding and the facetime, not only within the university, but also across the country and supporting them internationally,” he said.</p>
<p>French’s departure from NEXT Canada comes as accelerators, incubators, startups, and businesses generally, are facing a difficult time due to the ongoing economic impacts of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Like many startup organizations in Canada, NEXT Canada relies heavily on events and in-person programming for its operations. When COVID-19 hit, many of these organizations were left to figure out how to push ahead. While Toronto-based incubator <a href="https://betakit.com/oneeleven-asks-startups-for-abated-rent-then-retracts-claiming-misunderstanding/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OneEleven</a> was shut down, many other accelerators and incubators have worked to offer a <a href="https://betakit.com/techstars-to-hold-startup-weekend-virtually-as-it-shifts-event-focus-to-covid-19-solutions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">virtual model</a>.</p>
<p>NEXT Canada had to make its own challenging decisions. “We at NEXT have taken measures to ensure that we can continue with our mission,” said Patterson. “While it hasn’t been easy getting here, our virtual doors are open for business.”</p>
<p>Patterson explained that when the business implications of COVID-19 became clear, NEXT Canada “took a very hard look” at its expenses and forecasts.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/university-of-toronto-receives-100-million-for-ai-innovation-centre/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Toronto receives $100 million for AI innovation centre</a></strong></p>
<p>“Heading into this gruelling exercise, we kept an eye on keeping our talented team in place so that we could continue to deliver on our mission to the highest degree. Ultimately, we were able to stabilize our organization (and team) thanks to several cost-cutting measures.”</p>
<p>NEXT Canada has moved to offering its accelerator programming virtually, and <a href="https://betakit.com/11-startups-to-pitch-at-next-canadas-virtual-venture-reveal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently hosted</a> a virtual version of its NEXT Venture Reveal day. French said running this way has allowed the accelerator to work with speakers that would not normally be able to travel to participate in the in-person programming.</p>
<p>In mid-March, just as COVID-19 was forcing remote work, the accelerator also closed applications for Next Founders, its growth-stage program. French noted that given the calibre of startups that applied this year, NEXT Canada decided to open up a handful of extra spots, in spite of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In order to ensure continued operations, NEXT Canada eliminated discretionary expenses across all departments (such as travel, events, and discretionary sponsorships) and applied for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), with Patterson expressing hope that this will allow NEXT Canada to retain its employees.</p>
<p>Patterson told BetaKit NEXT Canada was also able to get support from its corporate partners and donors. RBC, Scotiabank, Magna, EY, and Flybits all provided aid to help NEXT Canada, alongside support the accelerator receives from the provincial government and through the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[NEXT Canada has] created a sustainable revenue stream for the next 2-5 years.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“Our donors continue to play an important part in providing financial support in aid of our mission,” said Patterson. “Our current revenue model is pledge based, and we have therefore created a sustainable revenue stream for the next 2-5 years.”<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having spent almost a decade in the accelerator and startups space in Canada, French told BetaKit, “there&#8217;s no doubt that there will be tough times and tough decisions that need to be made for a number of accelerators and incubators across the country.”</p>
<p>“We know that there are going to be startups and larger well-established corporates and not-for-profits that go bankrupt or have issues around financial viability,” he said. “I suspect given the proliferation of accelerators and incubators in Canada, and around the world, that they will be no different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;re making decisions right now,” he added. “We&#8217;re all making decisions right now that aren’t unlike the advice we&#8217;re giving to entrepreneurs that we support.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/board-communicated-shutdown-decision-to-oneeleven-executive-director/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Board communicated shutdown decision to OneEleven executive director</a></strong></p>
<p>Commending Canadian governments of all levels for the programs they have put in place amid COVID-19, French encouraged accelerators and incubators to take advantage of such measures. “Where possible, accelerators and incubators need to tap into those programs … and figure out ways to reduce costs so that they can continue to support the entrepreneurs given these times,” he said.</p>
<p>“Organizations that support and nurture entrepreneurship &#8211; and plug them into the network and help them not make mistakes &#8211;  that will help the Canadian economy and help us right-size the economy to get on the other side,” French said.</p>
<p>NEXT Canada has no immediate plans to fill French’s now vacant role with the accelerator, however, Patterson called the position “integral to the continued success and growth of our NEXT entrepreneurs.”</p>
<p>“We do plan to find someone exceptional to lead recruitment, community and alumni, when the time is right,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of Shopify volunteers have created <a href="https://www.covidshield.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">COVID Shield</a>, an app that offers COVID-19 exposure notifications, aimed at helping support contact tracing efforts.</p>
<p>The Shopify employees built the app to be free to use, with CEO Tobi Lütke tweeting on Friday that COVID Shield &#8220;can be deployed in any country, translated, and modified to local requirements.&#8221; He added that the app is audited and open source.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;No more &#8216;we don&#8217;t have the local capabilities to develop this&#8217; arguments,&#8221; Lütke wrote.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">

We build <a href="https://t.co/erixIZ0Ey0">https://t.co/erixIZ0Ey0</a> so that everyone who needs to pivot can do so quickly and not start from zero. <a href="https://t.co/DnrwRnCaSL">https://t.co/DnrwRnCaSL</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Tobi Lutke ???? (@tobi) <a href="https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1263845940257062912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Contact tracing is the practice of tracking people who may have come in contact with an infected person. Tracing those people allows them to get tested and isolate if needed. As economies begin to open up, contact tracing is widely viewed as vital to pandemic recovery.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Apple and Google <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/apple-google-covid-app-1.5577166" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released</a> smartphone technology, which they teamed up to build, in order to help notify individuals automatically if they may have been exposed to the COVID-19. The initiative uses Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app was near another app user who may have tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Apple and Google have noted that 22 countries have already expressed interest in building contact tracing phone apps using their technology.</p>
<p>During his daily briefing on Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emphasized the importance of contact tracing as Canada moves into the next phase of pandemic recovery. He said his government is looking to work closely with provincial governments to do so, offering volunteers and financial support.</p>
<p>The prime minister also spoke to Apple and Google&#8217;s efforts, noting that Canada has been working closely with the two tech giants on contact tracing. He added, however, that the federal government is working with a number of different partners on contract tracing apps and hopes that the country will adopt just one.</p>
<p>He said a &#8220;clearer picture&#8221; on this decision is likely to come in June.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/government-expands-criteria-of-40000-small-business-ceba-loan-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Government expands criteria of $40,000 small business CEBA loan program</a></strong></p>
<p>The Shopify volunteers created their contact tracing app based on the exposure notification technology provided by Apple and Google. The COVID Shield website called the Silicon Valley tech giants&#8217; tech &#8220;the most privacy-preserving approach currently available.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea behind COVID Shield is to provide a &#8220;private, secure, and easy-to-use tool to help governments launch their own exposure notification systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shopify, Apple, and Google are not the only tech companies looking to provide contact tracing solutions. Waterloo-based startup <a href="https://blog.mappedin.com/product-101-contact-tracing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mappedin</a>, which offers indoor mapping services, has created its own contact tracing solution with the aim to help make workplaces safer. Mappedin actually <a href="https://betakit.com/today-in-company-partnerships-mappedin-collaborates-with-apple-stocksy-partners-with-adobe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">works with Apple</a> to provide &#8220;indoor positioning&#8221; on iOS devices as well as with a variety of partners for Android devices.</p>
<p>Toronto-based startup Cinchy, which has created a data collaboration network focused on finance and healthcare, has also <a href="https://thelogic.co/news/cinchy-wants-to-create-a-covid-19-data-command-centre-for-canadas-health-agencies/?gift=738c9c93ae36e627fb821fddca0fe846" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">been in talks</a> with Canadian health authorities to help them connect and collect data amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Shopify has open sourced its work behind COVID Shield, making the app available on GitHub. Lütke also noted on Twitter that all the design assets have been shared open-source on Figma.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two Canadian solutions are among the eleven winners of the <a href="http://www.vale.com/canada/EN/sustainability/Pages/covid-19-challenge.aspx#etapas" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vale COVID-19 Challenge</a>, a competition collectively offering up to $1 million USD to help solutions developed by companies, institutions, or professionals, go to market.</p>
<p>Nearly 1,800 solutions were submitted to the challenge globally, of which over 300 came from Canada. Startup <a href="http://flosonicsmedical.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FloSonics Medical</a> and robotics team <a href="https://www.team1305.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">First Team 1305</a>, both based in Northern Ontario, were selected as funding recipients.</p>
<blockquote><p>The challenge sought solutions that could be deployed within 15 days of the approval date.</p></blockquote>
<p>The challenge was launched in Canada, and solutions were reviewed by a select group of employees from Vale Base Metals, which operates in 10 countries, as well as external partners and supporters. Some of the Canadian partners included Norcat, MaRS Discovery District, Telus Health, and the University Health Network.</p>
<p>The competition sought low to zero-cost solutions that could be deployed to the end-user within 15 days of their approval date. The challenge was open to a variety of solutions, including those addressing risk management and prevention, patient monitoring, health process improvements, and logistics, among others. </p>
<p>“The participation on this initiative was incredible &#8230; and is a great example of how open innovation can bring people together globally as partners in finding innovative solutions to critical problems,” said Afzal Jessa, chief digital officer of Vale Base Metals.</p>

<p>FloSonics Medical is a <a href="https://betakit.com/flosonics-raises-5-million-for-device-helping-hospitals-track-critically-ill-patients/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">venture-backed</a> startup based in Sudbury, Ontario, that develops and commercializes wearable sensors aimed to improve the management of critically ill patients both inside and outside of the hospital. </p>
<p>To help during the current pandemic, FloSonics developed a wearable, wireless, single-use monitor, which allows clinicians to access critical information about a COVID-19 patient’s cardiovascular state remotely via Bluetooth. The funds received from Vale will help FloSonics increase the capacity to produce and deliver these devices which have already been cleared for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>&#8220;FloSonics is pleased to partner with Vale in this important initiative,” said Joe Eibl, CEO of FloSonics Medical. “Our aim with this solution is to facilitate monitoring where resources are limited, and to help support clinical decisions to improve patient outcomes.”</p>

<p>First Team 1305, a group of high school robotics students from North Bay, Ont., created a do-it-yourself ultra-violet (UV) <a href="https://www.team1305.org/diy-uv-sterilizer-cart" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sterilizer</a> that cleans personal protective equipment. The team currently has two prototypes being used at the North Bay Regional Health Centre in its emergency department and intensive care unit. </p>
<p>The funds from the challenge will allow the team to keep developing these prototypes and build an open-source model to be shared globally. First Team 1305 also plans to purchase materials to build 50 units to donate to local hospitals and medical centers.</p>
<p>“The funds provided by Vale for the UV Sterilizer Project will have a positive impact on the people at risk of COVID-19 in our community and will help others to make a difference in their community as well,” said Fionna Truong, a First Team 1305 student. </p>
<p>“The safety equipment and masks are key in keeping our first responders and those at risk safe. By being able to sterilize and reuse masks we will be able to continue protecting our community, and with the help from Vale, others will now be able to help their community,” Truong added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Atlantic Canada innovation hub <a href="https://voltaeffect.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Volta</a> is opening applications for a new six-week program led by various industry experts to guide entrepreneurs through the changing business landscape following the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The program, called <a href="https://voltaeffect.com/recovery/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Recovery</a>, will launch in mid-June and is expected to take startup founders through key areas of focus, to navigate the gradual re-opening of our region, and understand best practices following this pandemic. Focus areas include runway management, financial planning, funding sources, sales, marketing in the age of uncertainty, and human resources.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We want to help entrepreneurs create well-rounded strategies to&#8230; position themselves for success following this pandemic.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“Startups and small businesses in Atlantic Canada are the heart of our economy, playing a significant role in creating jobs and making our communities more vibrant,” said Martha Casey, COO and interim CEO of Volta. “COVID-19 has created unprecedented challenges for companies of all sizes, and with this new program, we want to help entrepreneurs create well-rounded strategies to effectively position themselves for success following this pandemic.”</p>
<p>Startups based in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island are eligible for this program. Sessions will take place virtually on Tuesday mornings, with expert-led office hours available to participants in the days that follow.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/the51-atlantic-womens-venture-fund-partner-on-women-focused-venture-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The51, Atlantic Women’s Venture Fund partner on women-focused venture initiative</a></strong></p>
<p>Business is <a href="https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/nova-scotia-businesses-slowly-reopening-after-pandemic-closures-1.4946037" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slowly</a> returning to normal in the Atlantic Canada region as COVID-19 restrictions began easing in recent days, but a <a href="https://betakit.com/survey-half-of-canadian-east-coast-startups-are-feeling-financial-impact-of-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent survey</a> from Halifax-based early-stage venture capital firm Concrete Ventures found that many startups are still taking a hit. </p>
<p>About half of Canadian East Coast startups surveyed said they are feeling the financial impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The same report found 16 percent of respondents reported laying off staff, and a further 17 percent of Atlantic Canada startups indicated their business is not eligible for any government relief programs.</p>
<p>Volta was founded in 2010, and primarily focuses on incubation and corporate innovation as well as supporting regional startups with programming and workspace.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Volta closed its co-working space and meeting rooms on March 16.</p>
<p>The new program comes about two months after Jesse Rodgers <a href="https://betakit.com/jesse-rodgers-out-as-ceo-of-atlantic-canada-hub-volta/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">departed</a> his role as CEO of the Halifax-based incubator.</p>
<p>The Recovery program is being offered at no cost to participants, but spaces are limited. Those interested in participating must <a href="https://voltaeffect.com/recovery/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apply</a> before the end of June 5. Successful applicants will be contacted by June 8, and the program will begin on June 16.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vancouver-based startup <a href="http://artms.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ARTMS Products</a>, which produces medical isotopes, has raised a $26.4 million CAD ($19 million USD) Series A funding round. This round brings the company’s total funding to more than $30 million CAD ($26 million USD).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This funding gives us the financial flexibility to&#8230; revolutionize the nuclear medicine industry.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The round was led by New York-based <a href="https://deerfield.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deerfield Management</a> with investment from existing investor Global Health Science (<a href="https://www.quarkventure.com/global-health-sciences-fund-quark-venture-and-gf-securities-provide-key-investment-in-pi-therapeutics-19-7-million-series-b-financing-for-development-of-novel-cancer-drug/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GHS</a>) Fund, a seed investor also based in Vancouver. A spokesperson for the company told BetaKit the round closed on May 13. ARTMS aims to address the<a href="https://www.advisory.com/research/imaging-performance-partnership/the-reading-room/2018/03/medical-isotope" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> current global shortage</a> of medical isotopes, which are used as a component of nuclear medicine. </p>
<p>Nuclear medicine involves the application of radioactive substances to provide diagnostic information and treat some medical conditions, by using radioactive substances. According to the World Nuclear Association, over <a href="https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applications/radioisotopes-research/radioisotopes-in-medicine.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">40 million</a> nuclear medicine procedures are performed annually, and demand for radioisotopes is increasing at up to five percent each year.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/26-vancouver-hospitals-adopt-healthcare-app-designed-by-tech-companies-bc-government/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">26 Vancouver hospitals adopt healthcare app designed by tech companies, BC government</a></strong></p>
<p>The world’s supply of medical isotopes previously depended on a nuclear reactor located in Chalk River, Ontario, which <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/medical-isotope-shortage-feared-as-chalk-river-reactor-closes/article32582481/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stopped production</a> in 2016 after facility costs increased. That closure impacted what has been described as an <a href="https://www.advisory.com/research/imaging-performance-partnership/the-reading-room/2018/03/medical-isotope" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">already fragile</a> international supply chain of medical isotopes.</p>
<p>ARTMS produces a hardware device that helps produce media isotopes through a cyclotron, or particle accelerator. The device uses a cyclotron, which is a particle accelerator, to create medical isotopes. Its flagship offering, called the QISTM, uses medical cyclotrons to allow users to produce high volumes of radiopharmaceutical products.</p>
<p>The company was spun off in 2010 from <a href="https://www.triumf.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Triumf</a>, Canada&#8217;s national particle accelerator centre located at the University of British Columbia. ARTMS will use the new financing to develop a new diagnostic isotope and to expand the commercialization of the QISTM for the production of more medical isotopes. </p>
<p>&#8220;This funding gives us the financial flexibility to leverage our [QISTM] technology and partner with customers to revolutionize the nuclear medicine industry by enabling global access to cyclotron-produced medical isotopes,&#8221; said Charles S. Conroy, CEO of ARTMS.</p>

<p>In 2017, the company closed a <a href="http://artms.ca/artms-products-inc-raises-us3-million-to-advance-a-safe-alternative-way-to-locally-produce-medical-isotopes-and-avoid-future-supply-distruptions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$4.1 million CAD</a> seed funding deal from Quark Venture to help it pursue business in China. That same year, it deployed a system in Denmark and signed a deal with GE Healthcare for new hardware.</p>
<p>This year, ARTMS has forged new partnerships, including one with <a href="https://appliedradiationoncology.com/articles/imaginab-artms-partner-to-manufacture-89zr-cd8-immunopet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ImaginAb</a> to enhance the creation of a new proprietary antibody, in addition to <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/06/2028486/0/en/ARTMS-and-Telix-Pharmaceuticals-Announce-Manufacturing-Collaboration.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telix Pharmaceuticals</a> to manufacture a prostate cancer diagnostic.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the seed investor in ARTMS we are pleased to continue to support the company and the development of its groundbreaking technology,” said says Karimah Es Sabar, CEO and partner at Quark Venture LP and director of the GHS Fund. “The QISTM technology has the ability to satisfy the rapidly increasing demand for high-quality medical isotopes and unlock the potential of medical isotopes for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Montreal-based Lightspeed POS has released its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full fiscal year, both ending March 31, 2020. All figures...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Montreal-based <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lightspeed POS</a> has released its <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/lightspeed-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020-financial-results-841018486.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">financial results</a> for the fiscal fourth quarter and full fiscal year, both ending March 31, 2020. All figures reported are in US dollars.</p>
<p>Lightspeed’s total revenue grew 70 percent to $36.3 million in Q4 and grew 56 percent to $120.6 million in the full year. By March 31, Lightspeed had $210 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are witnessing a historic shift in the way small and medium-sized businesses&#8230; engage in commerce.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Dax Dasilva, CEO, Lightspeed</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Lightspeed’s net loss was $53.5 million for the full year compared to a net loss of $183.5 million the year prior. Net loss totalled $18.6 million in Q4 compared to $96.1 million in Q4 2019. The net loss in Q4 2019 was <a href="https://betakit.com/lightspeed-sees-36-revenue-growth-in-first-quarterly-report-since-ipo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">impacted</a> by fees related to Lightspeed’s <a href="https://betakit.com/lightspeed-files-for-anticipated-ipo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initial public offering</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, the company reported “record uptake” of Lightspeed eCommerce, Lightspeed Delivery, and Lightspeed Payments offerings in March. The company attributed this record adoption to increased digital adoption and a need for an omnichannel cloud solution during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are witnessing a historic shift in the way small and medium-sized businesses, the businesses at the heart of our communities, engage in commerce,” said Dax Dasilva, Lightspeed’s founder and CEO. “Being omnichannel has never been more important.”</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown retailers and restaurants alike into turmoil due to legally-enforced social distancing measures. In early April, Lightspeed <a href="https://betakit.com/lightspeed-sees-reduced-demand-for-e-commerce-services-as-restaurants-retailers-heavily-affected/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forecasted</a> COVID-19 would have a negative impact on its financial performance. </p>
<p>In that April business statement, Lightspeed noted that the pandemic was impacting Lightspeed’s retail and hospitality customers, including these merchants’ gross transactional value, their demand for Lightspeed’s services, and churn rates due to business closures.</p>

<p>In Q4, recurring software and payments revenue increased by 70 percent to $31.8 million. Also in Q4, the number of customers using more than one Lightspeed module grew from 33 percent to 40 percent year-over-year.</p>
<p>Lightspeed reported that a record number of existing customers agreed to switch to Lightspeed <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/pos/retail/payments/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Payments</a> in Q4. With the portion of customers signing up for Payments alongside their core software subscription increasing in Q4, surpassing 60 percent. </p>
<p>Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, the company also tracked new customer demand in April and a 50 percent increase in total volume for retailers from March. Lightspeed’s <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/ecommerce/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eCommerce</a> service also reportedly saw a 400 percent increase in volumes processed by retailers in April compared to February 2020 levels. </p>
<p>Despite some early positive signs for the POS provider, the company declined to provide a financial outlook for the following fiscal period, attributing the decision to the economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lightspeed did not provide an outlook for the following fiscal period, citing uncertainty caused by the pandemic.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Heightened uncertainty in the global economy is having an acute impact on everyone, including our customers, their consumers, our partners, our suppliers and our employees,” the company said. “The degree to which COVID-19 will affect our business, operating results, and financial condition in upcoming quarters will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot currently be predicted.”</p>
<p>Lightspeed added that it has “strategically re-directed discretionary spending and funding for certain go-to-market initiatives towards solution innovation,” did not provide specifics. The company has also rolled out several <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initiatives</a> designed to support merchants during the crisis. </p>
<p>Some of these initiatives include more affordable access to its solutions, staff deployments to support the quick onboarding of new merchants, and #lightspeedlocal initiative, which reimburses employees who shop through e-commerce or dine takeout or delivery from their local Lightspeed retailers and restaurants.</p>

<p>Lightspeed also recently announced a collaboration with the <a href="http://www.cqcd.org/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Conseil Québécois du Commerce de Détail</a> to provide Québec-based retailers with personalized assistance and point-of-sale solutions. The initiative is hoped to help businesses adapt to pandemic-related changes in consumer behaviour. </p>
<p>In its financial report, Lightspeed also noted it had completed a $130 million bought deal offering in February. A bought deal is a securities offering in which an investment firm commits to buy the entire offering from the client company. BMO Capital Markets and National Bank Financial were joint book-runners for the offering.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the effects of COVID-19 will cause some uncertainty for the foreseeable future, we are encouraged by the signs we are seeing for Lightspeed&#8217;s solutions and what it signals for our long-term potential,” said Brandon Nussey, Lightspeed&#8217;s chief financial officer. “With over $210 million in unrestricted cash we are well-positioned to invest smartly through this period and emerge as an even stronger global leader for our customers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Vancouver-based robo advisor startup WealthBar has been fully acquired by one of Canada’s largest wealth management firms, CI Financial.</p>
<p>This week, CI Financial announced that it had extended its ownership of WealthBar to 100 percent of the company, with plans to rebrand and integrate WealthBar into a new online investment platform.</p>
<blockquote><p>“[This is] one of the ideal outcomes we had in mind when we launched the company.”<br />
<em> &#8211; Tea Nicola, co-founder &#038; CEO, WealthBar</em></p></blockquote>
<p>WealthBar was <a href="https://betakit.com/wealthbar-assante-wealth-management-to-launch-online-investing-platform/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first acquired</a> by CI Financial in January 2019. At the time, WealthBar executives maintained a 25 percent minority stake, which CI Financial has now bought out.</p>
<p>CI Financial plans to rebrand WealthBar to CI Direct Investing and combine it with its own “discount broker” Virtual Brokers. The two will be integrated to become one online investing platform under the CI Direct Investing brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://betakit.com/what-wealthbars-tea-nicola-learned-from-the-companys-first-1000-customers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Founded</a> in 2014, WealthBar offers a suite of investment services that combine technology with human advisors. WealthBar&#8217;s app offers personalized investment services from humans as well as its robo-advisor.</p>
<p>In 2016, the Vancouver startup raised <a href="https://betakit.com/wealthbar-raises-5-5-million-to-build-on-its-personalized-client-experience/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$5.5 million</a> from Nicola Wealth Management. According to Crunchbase, the $5.5 million is the startup’s total funding to date.</p>
<p>Following the 2019 acquisition, WealthBar continued to operate as a stand-alone business. Last year it signed a partnership with <a href="https://betakit.com/wealthbar-assante-wealth-management-to-launch-online-investing-platform/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Assante Wealth Management</a> and acquired <a href="https://betakit.com/snap-projections-acquired-by-fintech-startup-wealthbar-financial-services/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Snap Projections</a>, a financial planning software startup.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/what-wealthbars-tea-nicola-learned-from-the-companys-first-1000-customers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">What Wealthbar’s Tea Nicola learned from the company’s first 1,000 customers</a></strong></p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO of WealthBar Tea Nicola called the full acquisition “one of the ideal outcomes we had in mind when we launched the company.”</p>
<p>“This is about alignment,” she told BetaKit. “It made sense to join the two companies together, sharing the same goals.”</p>
<p>With the full acquisition and rebrand, WealthBar’s leadership team will remain the same. Nicola told BetaKit that herself, co-founder Chris Nicola, David Dyck, head of client services, and Neville Joanes, chief investment officer, “remain committed to bringing our clients great investing products and financial advice.”</p>
<p>“We’re only getting better. This change gives us momentum and additional resources to innovate faster,” Nicola added. “In terms of operations, clients will have the same investing experience they’ve come to trust and expect, plus we’ll be adding even more options on the platform, starting with self-directed investing.”</p>
<p>In terms of Snap Projections, Nicola told BetaKit, WealthBarcontinues to invest in expanding access to Snap Projections. “Now we can do so even more efficiently,” she added. “It’s already part of our own adviser operations and over the last few months, we’ve made it available to advisers within the CI family.”</p>

<p>CI Financial noted that WealthBar has been a “strong contributor” to the firm’s digital transformation. It pointed to WealthBar’s work creating Assante Connect, an online investment service managed by WealthBar exclusively for clients of Assante Wealth Management, as well as PPI Valet, a platform created by the startup that helps insurance advisors manage and grow the investment component of their business.</p>
<p>The firm added that fully acquiring WealthBar and rebranding to CI Direct Investing is part of its “strategic priority” to expand its digital wealth management platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;WealthBar and Virtual Brokers have posted strong growth and these changes will set the stage for further success,&#8221; said Kurt MacAlpine, CEO of CI Financial. &#8220;The unified CI Direct Investing brand will be consistent with the new branding strategy for CI Financial, making it clear that these platforms are part of a large, integrated asset and wealth management company.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Startup Canada has announced the second annual Canadian Export Challenge (CXC), a competition for entrepreneurs to pitch and win up to $25,000 in cash...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Startup Canada has announced the second annual Canadian Export Challenge (<a href="https://www.startupcan.ca/cxc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CXC</a>), a competition for entrepreneurs to pitch and win up to $25,000 in cash and $100,000 in support, will be <a href="https://www.startupcan.ca/2020/05/the-canadian-export-challenge-goes-digital-to-support-entrepreneurs-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fully-digital</a> this year due to COVID-19. </p>
<p>The Canadian Export Challenge (CXC) has historically consisted of a series of one-day events across Canada, that are designed for startups and scale-ups who are thinking about, working towards, or are already exporting their products or services. </p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re no longer limited by geography, so we’re excited to be able to connect with entrepreneurs who haven’t been able to participate in past CXCs.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the 2020 event format will differ from past years, the competition will still take place regionally in September. In each region, entrepreneurs will be pitching to win $5,000 for scale-ups, $2,500 for startups, in addition to the $25,000 cash prize and $100,000 in services. This year’s competition will have two categories: startups and scale-ups, and entrepreneurs in both categories will complete their first-round pitches via online video submission.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that participants are competing with companies at similar stages of growth,” said Kayla Isabelle, executive director of Startup Canada. </p>
<p>“In spite of limitations presented by COVID-19, we’re excited about CXC’s new digital format,” she added. “We’re no longer limited by geography, so we’re excited to be able to connect with entrepreneurs who haven’t been able to participate in past CXCs.”</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/11-startups-to-pitch-at-next-canadas-virtual-venture-reveal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">11 startups to pitch at NEXT Canada’s virtual Venture Reveal</a></strong></p>
<p>CXC events are open and free to attend for all Canadian entrepreneurs, and anyone interested in learning more about the Canadian export ecosystem. Each one-day global accelerator will offer opportunities to learn from and connect with Canada’s global expansion support providers and gain privileged access to market intelligence, and a partner network to help them grow. </p>
<p>Beginning as a <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-export-challenge-offering-10000-to-entrepreneurs-going-global/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pilot program</a> in 2018, CXC <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-export-challenge-accepting-startup-applications/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">added</a> a number of cities across Canada for pitch competitions last year. This September, UPS, the Trade Commissioner Service, and Export Development Canada are collaborating with Startup Canada along with Mastercard and Scotiabank, and the event will be “powered” by Google Canada.</p>
<p>CXC is among a number of Canadian startup events that have had to go virtual this year due to the pandemic. Techstars, for example, recently held its <a href="https://betakit.com/techstars-to-hold-startup-weekend-virtually-as-it-shifts-event-focus-to-covid-19-solutions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Startup Weekend</a> online, and major tech conferences like <a href="https://betakit.com/collision-cancels-2020-in-person-conference-over-covid-19-fears/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Collision</a> are also being held digitally. </p>
<p>Entrepreneurs are invited to apply for CXC through video submissions starting June 1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.platformcalgary.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Platform Calgary</a>, an organization that offers access to space, programming, and advocacy for startups based in the city, has received a $30,000 investment from the federal government for its student-focused <a href="https://www.platformcalgary.com/programs-and-events/summer-incubator-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">summer incubator program</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p> “Students with these skills will create a pipeline of late-stage, investable companies.”<br />
<em>&#8211; David Yiptong, Platform Calgary</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The funding, delivered through the government’s <a href="https://www.wd-deo.gc.ca/eng/home.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Western Economic Diversification</a> Regional Development Agency (RDA), will be used to add 10 additional students to the program, bringing the total headcount of this year’s cohort to 22. Platform Calgary’s summer incubator program is aimed to provide student entrepreneurs with resources to launch and grow an innovative startup.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Giving students entrepreneurial opportunities early makes it more likely they will start multiple businesses and have higher success rates,” said David Yiptong, director of programs at Platform Calgary. “Students with these skills will create a pipeline of late-stage, investable companies that will contribute towards employment, economic growth, and industry transformation.”</p>
<p>The four-month program will see students, which have already been <a href="https://www.platformcalgary.com/programs-and-events/summer-incubator-program/meet-the-students/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">selected</a>, receiving support, a virtual workspace with startup community peers, and experienced advisors, as well as formal programming throughout the summer. The program officially began on May 11.</p>
<p>The structure will include lessons and workshops for participating students during the first nine weeks of the program, followed by two months of dedicated time for students to work on their projects. Due to COVID-19, the program will be delivered virtually.At the end of the summer, students will present their startup to a panel.</p>
<p>This year’s cohort includes 22 students from the University of Calgary, Mount Royal University, and the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology and includes six companies participating in an artificial intelligence stream. In addition to Platform Calgary, the Royal Bank of Canada and the University of Calgary are also supporters of the summer incubator program.</p>

<p>“Initiatives like the summer incubator program make a world of difference for young Canadians, setting them on the path to well-paying careers while bolstering the tech ecosystem in Alberta and across Canada,” said Mélanie Joly, minister of economic development and official languages.</p>
<p>“With the support of Western Economic Diversification Canada, the size of this incredible program will be doubled to help even more of Calgary’s young entrepreneurs pursue their dreams of a future in our tech sector,” Joly added.</p>
<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government recently committed <a href="https://betakit.com/government-reveals-details-on-962-million-regional-development-agencies-covid-19-funding/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$962 million</a> in new capital to RDAs and the Community Futures Network. The relief is meant to help businesses and organizations continue operations and continue to pay their employees. It is also available for projects by businesses, organizations, and communities to help prepare for the pandemic recovery.</p>
<p>Joly, who is responsible for the RDAs, encouraged companies including startups in the tech space to reach out to their respective RDAs about the relief earlier this month. Platform Calgary confirmed to BetaKit that its new funding is not related to this COVID-19 RDA relief.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.shopify.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shopify</a> has announced that it is now a “digital by default” company, meaning the majority of its employees will permanently work remotely.</p>
<blockquote><p>The company said it is still to retaining its current and future &#8220;recruitment hubs&#8221; across the country.</p></blockquote>
<p>The e-commerce giant’s more than 5,000 employees are currently working from home, and will continue to do so for the remainder of 2020. Its offices will be closed until 2021, and when 2020 ends, the “vast majority of the company” will continue to work remotely permanently, Shopify said.</p>
<p>In a statement to BetaKit, chief talent officer Brittany Forsyth said as the company moves to a decentralized way of working, it is still committed to retaining its current and future &#8220;recruitment hubs&#8221; in Toronto, Ottawa, Waterloo, Montreal, and Vancouver. </p>
<p>The statement reflects a dramatic shift in Shopify’s approach to work following the COVID-19 pandemic. While the company has maintained a commitment to physical presence in cities across North America, Forsyth’s statement makes it clear that Shopify sees them no longer as workplaces, but pools through which to draw local ecosystem talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of recruitment hubs, in each of our core cities in Canada, we will have a space that local employees can visit, while still allowing us to hire across the country for a decentralized, remote way of working,&#8221; a Shopify spokesperson told BetaKit.</p>

<p>Shopify said its offices will be “redesigned to empower new ways of collaborating and learning from each other,” and that the company will be investing in new tools to enable the team to work effectively.</p>
<p>“Everything about our culture from thriving on change, to building for the long term, to our focus on anti-fragility, has set the foundation for this decision,” said Forsyth. “This is a chance for us to lean into new ways of working, tap into new talent wherever they are, and help our merchants around the globe adapt to a new reality.”</p>

<p>The decision comes several months after Shopify announced <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-to-open-first-permanent-office-in-vancouver-hire-1000-employees/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plans</a> to open a 900,000 square-foot office in Vancouver, along with plans to hire 1,000 new employees in the city. A year ago, the company <a href="https://betakit.com/office-tour-of-shopifys-newly-renovated-toronto-location/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opened</a> another Toronto office and concurrently stated plans to double its employees in Toronto to 1,500 by 2022. That office marked Shopify’s third location in the city since it moved there in 2012. This was part of a $500 million commitment to expand its Toronto presence.</p>

<p>“Until recently, work happened in the office. We’ve always had some people remote, but they used the internet as a bridge to the office,” said CEO Tobi Lütke. “This will reverse now. The future of the office is to act as an on-ramp to the same digital workplace that you can access from your [work from home] setup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft for Startups Canada has entered into a new partnership with Dream Legacy Foundation in order to support diverse founders in the Canadian tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>The partnership will directly support new and existing programming for organizations that are part of Dream Legacy Foundation’s <a href="https://betakit.com/dream-maker-ventures-launches-diversity-program-for-underrepresented-entrepreneurs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Diversity Program</a> initiative.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The various different groups … are going to have a strong support system from a large scale tech company like Microsoft.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Microsoft, the idea behind the collaboration is to take “an inclusive and intersectional approach” to supporting diverse founders through strategic supports, targeted programs, and events “that will bridge the gaps in existing resources, and maximize entrepreneurial success across these communities.”</p>
<p> &#8220;We are proud partners with the multiple programs throughout Canada, building a foundation necessary to move our communities forward,” said Isaac Olowolafe, founder of the Dream Legacy Foundation. “This inaugural collaboration with Microsoft for Startups is an important step in the right direction to see proper representation in the tech community for people of colour, women, LGBTQ+, immigrant, refugee, and accessibility-focused founders.”</p>
<p>Dream Legacy Foundation originally <a href="https://betakit.com/dream-maker-ventures-launches-diversity-program-for-underrepresented-entrepreneurs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched</a> its Diversity Program in November. The initiative includes five partner groups: The Centre for Indigenous Innovation and Technology, Access to Success, Venture Out, Jumpstart, Scale without Borders.</p>
<p>Dream Legacy Foundation is a philanthropic organization that was founded by Olowolafe in 2017 with the goal of promoting economic inclusion of marginalized communities. Olowolafe is also the president of Dream Maker Inc., a Toronto-based asset management firm that works in a variety of verticals including real estate, development, property management, and insurance.</p>

<p>The Diversity Program was launched in partnership with Dream Maker Ventures, the investment arm of Dream Maker Inc., of which Olowolafe is also the founder and general partner.</p>
<p>Each of the five groups that are part of the Diversity Program will receive support from Microsoft for Startups for new and existing programming.</p>
<p>Microsoft for Startups Canada and Dream Legacy Foundation will work together to provide one on one expert support from Microsoft well as help startups develop new innovative technology and business foundations, and achieve scale <em> (Microsoft for Startups is also the sponsor of BetaKit’s AI Nation series, ed.)</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This inaugural collaboration with Microsoft for Startups is an important step in the right direction to see proper representation in the tech community.&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Adam Nanjee, managing director of Canada for Microsoft for Startups, told BetaKit the partnership will also see Microsoft provide networking with its other partner hubs and venture capital partners. He added that Microsoft will also be taking a role in helping facilitate future events hosted by the groups, “really putting the full force of Microsoft for Startups behind that.”</p>
<p>On a quarterly and monthly basis, Microsoft for Startups will also work with Dream Legacy Foundation to offer “curated founder events,” with Nanjee noting that the idea is “to ensure that all of the different communities are included in a lot of the different startup ecosystem events throughout Canada.”</p>
<p>“This partnership between Microsoft for Startups Canada and Dream Legacy Foundation is really going to be about ensuring that the various different groups &#8230; are going to have a strong support system from a large scale tech company like Microsoft,” Nanjee said to BetaKit. “It&#8217;s one thing to say ‘go out and build a great startup and be innovative,’ it&#8217;s another thing to actually work with one of the world&#8217;s largest tech companies and actually do that.”</p>
<p>This is the latest in a <a href="https://betakit.com/microsoft-partners-with-invest-ottawa-to-scale-public-sector-startups/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">growing list</a> of partnerships and commitments for Microsoft for Startups Canada. The group is part of a global organization that was<a href="https://startups.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/canadian-startup-veteran-adam-nanjee-joins-microsoft-for-startups-team/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> launched</a> by Microsoft in late 2018 with $500 million, dedicated to helping local startups with sales, marketing, and tech support.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/the51-atlantic-womens-venture-fund-partner-on-women-focused-venture-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The51, Atlantic Women’s Venture Fund partner on women-focused venture initiative</a></strong></p>
<p>Microsoft for Startups launched <a href="https://betakit.com/microsoft-for-startups-names-adam-nanjee-as-managing-director-for-canada/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in Canada</a> in January 2019. The organization has existing partnerships with Invest Ottawa, MaRS and OneEleven in Toronto, Volta in Halifax, Startup Edmonton, and BC Tech in Vancouver. This partnership with Dream Legacy Foundation marks Microsoft for Startups Canada’s first with a non-innovation hub organization.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve got quite a few partnerships across Canada primarily with innovation hubs, from Halifax to Vancouver, but one of the things that we had been looking at for quite some time was, ‘is there a group that really represented the entire underrepresented communities,’” said Nanjee, noting that one of the core parts of Microsoft for Startups’ strategy is around diversity, inclusion, and underrepresented founders.</p>
<p>“Now, given the unprecedented times that we&#8217;re in, it&#8217;s even more impactful that we&#8217;re doing this,” the managing director added. “This is a time where large companies like Microsoft, and organizations like Microsoft or Startups, have to really step up and build and be a pillar for the community. I think with the current situation at hand, this partnership will be even more impactful and really will ensure that &#8230; these founders have some runway and path to scale their business.”</p>
<p>Dream Legacy Foundation recently supported the Canadian Women’s Chamber of Commerce (CanWCC) in publishing a report that pointed to the effects of COVID-19 on underrepresented, Canadian founders.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://betakit.com/report-reveals-widespread-impact-of-covid-19-on-underrepresented-entrepreneurs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initial results</a> of that survey revealed that 85 percent of respondents had lost contracts, customers, or revenue during the crisis. The survey findings were used to form <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-groups-urge-governments-to-implement-funding-for-underrepresented-entrepreneurs-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recommendations</a> to policymakers, including urging Canadina governments to implement emergency funding for underrepresented entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the Government of Canada committed <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-government-commits-15-million-in-covid-19-support-to-women-entrepreneurs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$15 million</a> to support women entrepreneurs amid the ongoing economic crisis brought on by COVID-19. At the same time, another investment of $25 million over five years was announced to provide assistance to Black community organizations. The funding will allow grassroots organizations to apply for grants of up to $100,000, starting in late spring.</p>
<p>Another $350 million commitment, also announced Saturday, will see the United Way Centraide Canada, the Canadian Red Cross, and the Community Foundations of Canada help disburse funding to local community-based organizations working with vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities, LGBTQ2, newcomers, women, children and youth, and Indigenous communities and racialized communities, such as Black Canadians.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly one-quarter of Canadian startups have made layoffs in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, representing 5.5 percent of the overall workforce, according to a new <a href="https://www.prospect.fyi/reports" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from Prospect and BDC Capital.</p>
<p>The report is part of a new quarterly series that will look at the state of talent demand in Canada’s tech startup sector and “set a benchmark” for what progress has been made and where the sector is headed. </p>
<blockquote><p>Thirty-nine percent of startups have postponed their next raise amid the crisis.</p></blockquote>
<p>“We are proud to announce the release of our first public report, the State of Startup Talent: Q1 to COVID-19,” said Marianne Bulger, CEO of Prospect. “This report, and those to follow, aims to increase the depth and frequency of data released to the public about the state of talent demand in Canada’s tech startup sector.”</p>
<p>The first quarterly report was assembled from job postings and survey data collected between January and April. Overall, new job creation at Canadian startups dropped by over 60 percent in April. As of April 30, live job postings declined by 33 percent since the start of the COVID-19 crisis. The report noted that job postings include all postings on a career page, regardless of how long the posting has been active and that these postings are included in the data collected by Prospect.</p>
<p>Data collected from Prospect’s <a href="https://www.thehelplist.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">COVID-19 Talent Help List</a> found that 23.9 percent of Canadian startups have made layoffs in the wake of the pandemic. The COVID-19 Talent Help List tracks self-identified tech industry workers whose employment status has changed as a result of COVID-19. The list was <a href="https://betakit.com/grassroots-database-launched-to-help-unemployed-canadian-startup-workers-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">created</a> by Prospect and a number of other organizations to help out-of-work talent in Canada’s startup sector find remote work during the COVID-19 global crisis, following widespread layoffs across the country.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/grassroots-database-launched-to-help-unemployed-canadian-startup-workers-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grassroots database launched to help unemployed Canadian startup workers amid COVID-19</a></strong></p>
<p>The most impacted categories of workers include marketing and communications, software engineering, and product, according to the report. In the wake of the pandemic, 73 percent of startups are scaling back hiring, while 36 percent having paused all hiring activities for the foreseeable future. A further 17 percent are reining in work perks and similar programs. </p>
<p>Despite the wave of layoffs in recent weeks, there are some startups, even those that made layoffs, that are now ramping up hiring efforts. For example, EdTech company Top Hat <a href="https://betakit.com/top-hat-restructures-makes-staff-reductions-as-covid-19-affects-higher-education/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">laid off</a> about three percent of its team, but told BetaKit it was still actively hiring in its product and engineering department. CareGuide, which <a href="https://betakit.com/as-sales-return-careguide-looks-to-rehire-furloughed-staff-following-covid-19-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">furloughed</a> approximately one-third of its full and part-time employees, is working to rehire some team members after the startup saw a return in sales.</p>
<p>“The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the job market is still relatively immeasurable, as unemployment and layoff numbers climb daily,” the report noted. “By combining data from Prospect&#8217;s multiple platforms, we&#8217;ve been able to develop some measurable inferences about the devastating impact this crisis has had at all levels of our national tech workforce.”</p>

<p>The report found that about 60 percent of respondents said they were raising or<br />
planning to raise financing in 2020. Of that, 69 percent of startups indicated that their raise has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 crisis and 39 percent have postponed their raise to a later date. Twenty-four percent are still on track to raise as planned. </p>
<p>Although startups may have concerns about raising capital during the crisis, some investors are actively looking to assure companies that they are still open for business. Toronto-based Hockeystick compiled a <a href="https://betakit.com/hockeystick-launches-list-of-active-funders-as-covid-19-creates-cash-crunch-for-canadian-startups/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list</a> of Canada’s most active startup funders to make it easier for startups to quickly access funding resources.</p>
<p>The Prospect and BDC Capital report also found that software engineering, in addition to sales and business development, remain the most in-demand roles of professional talent in the startup ecosystem. These roles make up 42 percent of the total job postings active during Q1 2020. Despite the high demand for these positions, software engineering and sales and business development roles were also on Prospect’s list of the most impacted workers by recent layoffs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.alberta-enterprise.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alberta Enterprise Corporation</a> has launched its third early-stage angel co-investment fund with a $10 million investment. BetaKit has confirmed <a href="https://www.acceleratefund.ca/news/alberta-enterprise-corporation-invests-10-million-into-its-third-accelerate-fund-for-local-startups/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Accelerate Fund III</a> is now closed. All figures are expressed in Canadian dollars.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are seeing more investable early-stage companies than ever in Alberta.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The aim of the fund is to provide capital to early-stage Alberta tech startups, in order to help them expand revenues and their teams, as well as get their products to market and help secure early customers. Accelerate Fund III will be managed by <a href="https://yaletown.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yaletown Partners</a> with the support of <a href="https://www.thea100.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The A100</a>, the same investment team that oversaw Fund II. </p>
<p>“We are excited to announce Accelerate Fund III, especially at such a moment of economic and global health uncertainty,” said Kristina Williams, CEO of Alberta Enterprise Corporation. “The fund is a great early-stage capital resource for the rapidly-growing Alberta tech sector. With this latest deployment of capital, we invite early-stage tech companies to stay and grow here, and to expand Alberta’s technology jobs and innovation.”</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/alberta-tech-sector-pens-open-letter-to-provincial-government-calling-for-urgent-support/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alberta tech sector pens open letter to provincial government calling for urgent support</a></strong></p>
<p>The Alberta government recently stated its desire to develop “an active and sustainable” angel capital ecosystem in the province in its most recent <a href="https://betakit.com/alberta-budget-2020-strikes-similar-chord-for-provinces-tech-sector/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">budget</a>. As part of that budget, Alberta Enterprise Corporation received $1.85 million to help it foster the province’s venture capital market.</p>
<p>Accelerate Fund co-invests alongside angel investors in financing rounds and will typically invest up to $500,000 on the same terms and conditions as private investors. The fund requires a matching investment from angels, and works with formal angel groups, super-angels, family funds, and individual angel investors.</p>
<p>The fund managers are looking for companies concentrated in the sectors of information and communication technology, clean and energy technology, life sciences, agriculture, and biotech.</p>
<p>The Accelerate Fund program started in 2012, and invests in tech startups that are private, incorporated, and have a head office and more than 50 percent of employees located in Alberta. The previous two funds, the first launched in 2012 and managed by AVAC Group, and the second launched in 2016, also totalled $10 million each. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for the fund confirmed to BetaKit that a portion of Fund II has been set aside for follow-on investment, but the budget for initial investments has been entirely allocated. Alberta Enterprise said for every dollar invested into Alberta startups with Accelerate Fund II, almost three times that amount has been invested by angels.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/city-of-edmonton-approves-new-innovation-entity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">City of Edmonton approves new innovation entity</a></strong></p>
<p>Of the companies that received Fund II investment over the last three years, one has exited. Passportal, which provides password and documentation management software, was <a href="https://startalberta.com/news/passportal-acquired-by-solarwinds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired</a> in April 2019 by SolarWinds, an IT management software provider. Alberta Enterprise said another one of Fund II’s portfolio companies has received significant follow on investment, and several others are planning their next round of fundraising.</p>
<p>“We are seeing more investable early-stage companies than ever in Alberta, along with more private investors interested in participating with the Accelerate Fund,” said Arden Tse, investment manager of Accelerate Fund III at Yaletown Partners. “As our technology sector grows, so does the vision for Accelerate Fund III. We seek to invest in a dozen or more Alberta startups around the province, and we are honoured to continue our efforts as fund managers.”</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We foresee a burgeoning tech sector across the province.”<br />
<em>&#8211; David Edmonds</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Yaletown Partners is a Vancouver-based firm that typically invests in software, data, and device technologies. In 2018, it closed over <a href="https://betakit.com/yaletown-partners-closes-over-half-of-200-million-innovation-growth-fund/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$100 million</a> in initial funding for its Innovation Growth Fund. The A100, which is also supporting Accelerate Fund III, is a membership-driven organization that assists tech entrepreneurs within the province.</p>
<p>“We are happy to continue working with Alberta Enterprise and Yaletown to inspire and help to grow Alberta’s technology entrepreneurs,” said David Edmonds, chairman of the industry chair for the A100. “We are continuing to see our tech community mature and expand and we foresee a burgeoning tech sector across the province.”</p>
<p>As COVID-19 has impacted many startups’ cash flow over recent months, members of Alberta’s tech community have <a href="https://betakit.com/alberta-tech-sector-pens-open-letter-to-provincial-government-calling-for-urgent-support/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stressed the importance</a> of government support for angel investing. James Lochrie, managing partner of Calgary-based Thin Air Labs and co-founder of Wave, told BetaKit BDC’s investment matching program, aimed to help startups affected by COVID-19, “<a href="https://betakit.com/alberta-tech-sector-pens-open-letter-to-provincial-government-calling-for-urgent-support/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">missed</a>” Alberta because of the province’s heavy reliance on early-stage angel investing. </p>
<p>This sentiment was echoed by Sandi Gilbert, managing partner of InterGen and board chair at the National Angel Capital Organization (NACO), when BetaKit <a href="https://betakit.com/bdc-exploring-matching-investments-for-angel-backed-startups-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> BDC was considering extending its matching program to angels and angel-backed startups. Notably, NACO, a national organization, recently opened an office in Calgary. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian E-commerce giant Shopify has expanded its financial services offering with the launch of Shopify Balance, a banking product for small businesses.</p>
<p>Shopify Balance is composed of three products, a bank account, card, and rewards program for Shopify merchants. According to Shopify, the idea behind the new offering is to provide financial services that are built for independent businesses and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>“Existing banking products for small businesses just suck,” said Kaz Nejatian, vice president and general manager of Shopify Financial Solutions. “The legacy banking system does not serve [small businesses] well.”</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;COVID completely changed everything we were doing; it was a massive pivot by the company.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking with BetaKit, Nejatian added, “Balance is a suite of three things, three separate things coming together. It&#8217;s a pseudo financial management product for merchants, two, it&#8217;s a business account that will replace their existing bank account, [and] three, it&#8217;s a business card designed with independent businesses in mind.”</p>
<p>Shopify revealed Balance at Reunite on Wednesday, a virtual event held by the company in place of Unite, its annual developer conference that was cancelled by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Nejatian explained that the idea for Balance came from Shopify pivoting to focus its efforts on the current global crisis.</p>
<p>“We were thinking about things around this space [prior], but, honestly, COVID completely changed everything we were doing; it was a massive pivot by the company,” Nejatian told BetaKit. “Tobi told everyone, literally told everyone, to &#8216;delete all your plans&#8217;. So we just went and deleted all the plans and came up with new ones, and this was part of it.”</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-partners-with-facebook-to-launch-facebook-shops/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shopify partners with Facebook to launch Facebook Shops</a></strong></p>
<p>The general manager of Shopify Financial Solutions added that Balance came from Shopify noticing difficulties its small business merchants faced getting access to capital from incumbent financial institutions during COVID-19.</p>
<p>“I honestly think our businesses fail today because the existing legacy products aren&#8217;t good enough,” said Nejatian. “Every small business ends up being run out of a shoebox, an Excel sheet, and honestly, it&#8217;s just bad for the survival of small businesses. Legacy banks are supposed to handle large companies like Shopify, they are not [made to] manage small, independent businesses.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our goal of Balance is to have [Shopify] become the financial operating system too.”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Shopify, two in five of the company&#8217;s merchants currently use their personal bank accounts and cards for business. “They’re combining their personal and business finances, making it difficult to measure the financial health of the business,” said Shopify.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shopify Balance is set to launch for early access in the United States (US) later this year. In expanding its finance and commerce stack, Shopify also expands its ever-growing list of partners, competitors, and &#8216;frenemies&#8217;. Setting aside traditional financial institutions, the new banking product would place Shopify in competition with challenger banks such as United Kingdom-based Revolut and Monzo, which are <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2020/monzo-ahead-of-revolut-for-us-banking-license/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">both working</a> to launch in the US. And while Nejatian would not provide a timeline as to when Balance will launch in Canada, when it does it will further encroach on the turf of fellow Canadian startups like Koho, Wealthsimple, and Borrowell. Competition across North America with the likes of Square and PayPal, among others, will only intensify. </p>
<p>Nejatian told BetaKit he doesn’t see Balance as a competitive offering, rather, it&#8217;s Shopify looking to solve a pain point for its merchants. He did add, however, that Shopify’s aim is to become the financial operating system for its merchants. “Today, Shopify is the retail operating system for our merchants,” he said. “Our goal of Balance is to have [Shopify] become the financial operating system too.”</p>
<p>“Shopify is a company dedicated to solving one problem, how do we enable more entrepreneurship around the world and we tackle these problems one at a time,” he added. “This is just the next most annoying thing.”</p>
<p>The Shopify Balance Account is what the company is calling, a “one-stop-shop” within the Shopify admin, that will allow merchants to pay bills, track expenses, and generally view cash flow. It is not restricted to use with the Shopify platform. Merchants will be able to use the account, as well as the card, for everyday business needs and expenses, similar to any traditional business banking account.</p>

<p>Shopify Balance Card will be offered as both a physical and virtual card that Shopify merchants can use when making any purchases. It will also be possible to make withdrawals from ATMs. Balance will come with no monthly fees or minimum balances.</p>
<p>Shopify says it will be working with a &#8220;trusted card issuing and bank partner&#8221; to launch Balance, but would not share details on who that partner would be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shopify Balance is not a bank and we are not pursuing banking licenses at this time,&#8221; a Shopify spokesperson told BetaKit. &#8220;We will be working with a trusted card issuing and bank partner, and we will work together to make sure we provide a merchant-centric program offering deposit insurance, security and support to Shopify merchants.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the US, applying for a banking licence can be an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/monzo-applies-for-us-banking-license-2020-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arduous process</a>, and is controlled by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which has exclusive authority to issue a federal or ‘national bank’ charter. Last month, Monzo <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/monzo-applies-for-us-banking-license-2020-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">applied</a> for its US banking licence, with approval expected to take between 18 months and 2 years.</p>
<p>Canada’s banking regulations have been <a href="https://betakit.com/incumbents-consumer-complacency-barriers-to-innovation-in-canadian-banking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similarly difficult</a> to navigate for startups looking to successfully break into the financial services space. <a href="https://betakit.com/koho-adds-national-bank-and-drive-as-investors-with-25-million-cad-series-b-extension/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Koho</a>, for example, which offers bank accounts and credit cards for consumers, currently works through partnerships with Visa and Peoples Trust Company. Similarly, Borrowell, which offers a range of financial products for Canadian businesses, works through Scotiabank, EQ Bank, Motusbank, and BMO to offer banking services.</p>
<p>Shopify would not provide detail on which financial institutions it may plan to partner with when it launches Balance in Canada, noting &#8220;we do not have an estimated launch date for Canada to share at this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The third aspect of Balance is a rewards program. Merchants will be able to earn cashback and discounts on everyday spending, including shipping and marketing.</p>
<p>Shopify Balance follows a number of <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-bringing-tap-chip-card-reader-to-canada/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent announcements</a> made by Shopify over the past month. In April, Shopify brought its small business loan fund, Shopify Capital,<a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-capital-launches-in-canada-to-provide-small-business-loans-to-merchants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> to Canada</a>, after adding <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-capital-makes-additional-200-million-available-to-merchants-affected-by-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$200 million</a> to the fund to help businesses affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Nejatian described Shopify Payments, Capital, and Balance as all coming together to make accessing e-commerce, loans, and banking services easier, and doing so “fully natively” through the Shopify platform.</p>
<p>At Reunite, Shopify also announced Shop Pay Installments, a flexible payment option for consumers making purchases through Shopify merchant stores. The “buy now, pay later” option, as Shopify calls it, gives consumers the option to split purchases into four equal payments over time, interest-free and with no additional fees to consumers.</p>
<p>Shopify noted that the idea behind the flexible payment option is meant to “increase a merchant’s average order size by making purchases more palatable to consumers &#8211; particularly in the current economic climate.”</p>
<p>Shop Pay Installments will be available to US merchants (eligible for Shopify Payments) later this year. The Ottawa-based e-commerce company is set to work with a partner to launch the program, though Nejatian would not share who the partner might be, noting it will be announced at a later date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.shopify.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shopify</a> has announced it is now actively accepting merchant <a href="https://www.shopify.com/fulfillment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">applications</a> for its fulfillment network. The news follows the e-commerce giant&#8217;s recent <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-begins-expansion-of-fulfillment-network-to-canadian-merchants-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">onboarding</a> of some Canadian merchants onto the network.</p>
<p>The network was previously only available for early access to qualifying merchants. Shopify said it has now “graduated” from the early access stage to grow its warehouse and geographical footprint. The company told BetaKit there have been under one million fulfillments since launch and that Shopify has heard &#8220;positive early feedback.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Along with access to its fulfillment network, Shopify is also offering a local delivery product for merchants globally.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shopify first <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-reveals-amazon-style-fulfillment-centres-3d-product-display-at-shopify-unite/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revealed</a> its plans to build the Shopify Fulfillment Network at its annual developer conference last June. The network, which consists of fulfillment centres that would allow merchants to distribute their products directly with Shopify, was initially only available to merchants in the United States. The company opened its first research and development hub in Ottawa in February, which was meant to, among other things, fulfill Canadian-based orders.</p>
<p>The company told BetaKit it was always part of Shopify&#8217;s plans to open an eighth warehouse and first Canadian location at the end of 2020. </p>
<p>Shopify’s fulfillment network is expected to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canadian-e-commerce-firm-shopify-looks-set-to-challenge-amazon-1.5339370" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rival</a> Amazon’s service, allowing merchants to scale their fulfillment strategies through Shopify’s partner network. </p>
<p>COO Harley Finkelstein said on Shopify&#8217;s quarterly financial call on May 6 that COVID-19&#8217;s disruption of global supply chains <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-sees-47-percent-revenue-growth-in-q1-2020-amid-impacts-of-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">validated</a> the company&#8217;s decision to expand into fulfillment.</p>
<p>“The decision to move into SFN [Shopify Fulfillment Network] feels like the right one, now more than ever,” Finkelstein said at the time. </p>
<p>Shopify noted as part of those quarterly results that more new merchants signed on to Shopify Fulfillment Network in Q1 2020 compared to any previous quarter since its launch in June. The company did not disclose to BetaKit the names of any partners that have been using the fulfillment service to date.</p>

<p>Shopify has committed a total of $1 billion to build out its fulfillment network. The fulfillment centres are expected to feature robotics-driven warehouses to improve fulfillment speed and accuracy. Last year, Shopify <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-acquiring-fulfillment-platform-6-river-systems-for-450-million-usd/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired</a> warehouse robotics company 6 River Systems for $450 million USD, its largest acquisition to date.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Shopify said it was working with fulfillment warehouse partners to ensure its centres are compliant with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention best practices and the health and safety for its warehouse employees amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Shopify said its fulfillment network is best for merchants who currently use a third-party logistics provider but whose delivery service levels &#8220;aren&#8217;t being met&#8221; and do not receive dedicated fulfillment support. The fulfillment network is also suitable for merchants serving US customers, who manage fewer than 2,000 stock keeping units and ship between 10 and 10,000 orders per day. </p>

<p>As part of <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/reunite" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reunite</a>, Shopify also announced it is offering a new local delivery product for merchants globally. The product allows merchants to define a local delivery area using distance radius or postal codes, set local delivery fees and minimum order price, and fulfill local orders through Shopify, Shopify POS, and Shopify Mobile.</p>
<p>Merchants can also use the new app to create optimized delivery routes, and send customer notifications when deliveries are on the way. The company noted that its average daily local orders for the six weeks ending April 24 grew 176 percent, compared to the six weeks prior, which coincided with the introduction of social distancing measures. The local delivery feature was also only available <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/local-methods/local-delivery" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in beta</a> previously. </p>
<p>The announcements were made at Reunite, Shopify’s virtual replacement for its annual in-person Unite Conference, which was <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-cancels-plans-to-host-virtual-annual-developer-conference/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancelled</a> due to the pandemic. On Tuesday, the company also revealed a partnership with Facebook to launch <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-partners-with-facebook-to-launch-facebook-shops/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook Shops</a>, a free tool aimed to help merchants create customized online storefronts for Facebook and Instagram.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Applications for the federal government&#8217;s Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) for small businesses are set to open May 25. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Applications for the federal government&#8217;s Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) for small businesses are set to open May 25.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Wednesday that the application portal, which will be available through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, will be open later this month.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We implore and expect landlords and building owners to understand that we are all in this together.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The rent relief program, which was <a href="https://betakit.com/trudeau-announces-75-percent-rent-relief-program-for-small-medium-sized-businesses/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> mid-April, is meant to help lower rent for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) affected by COVID-19. CECRA will allow SMBs to pay just 25 percent of their monthly rent, with governments and property owners absorbing the other 75 percent.</p>
<p>The program offers unsecured, forgivable loans to eligible commercial property owners in order to allow them to reduce rent and help them meet operating expenses on commercial properties. Property owners are required to offer a minimum of a 75 percent rent reduction for the months of April, May, and June.</p>
<p>The CECRA is available for small business tenants that have been impacted by COVID-19 and are paying less than $50,000 per month in gross rent, with annual revenues of less than $20 million. The tenants must have experienced at least a 70 percent drop in pre-COVID-19 revenues.</p>
<p>Trudeau hinted that the government is working on a rent relief program for larger companies, with details set to be shared &#8220;soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CECRA requires landlords and property owners to opt into the loan program, which has led to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/business-rent-key-restarting-economy-1.5563922" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concerns</a> about how the program is being administered. SMBs have pointed to the <a href="https://www.cfib-fcei.ca/en/media/news-releases/over-half-small-businesses-not-able-pay-may-rent-without-additional-support" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urgent need</a> for such rent support, as <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-covid-19-business-evictions-1.5553344" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fear</a> of eviction and businesses clossures has been growing.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Trudeau urged eligible landlords and tenants to apply for the program once it opens up, promising that relief will be provided shortly after May 25. </p>
<p>When asked why the federal government doesn&#8217;t choose to provide relief directly to tenants rather than landlords, Trudeau said, &#8220;We need [landlords] to understand that they have a deep, vested interest in having tenants [remain].&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/government-expands-criteria-of-40000-small-business-ceba-loan-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Government expands criteria of $40,000 small business CEBA loan program</a></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;If businesses go under due to COVID-19 we are all going to be worse off,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We implore and expect landlords and building owners to understand that we are all in this together &#8230; this program is there to help them and small businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of CECRA, the federal and <a href="https://betakit.com/how-some-provinces-are-facilitating-the-federal-commercial-rent-relief-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provincial governments</a> will collectively pay for 50 percent of the monthly rent through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, with property owners absorbing the remaining 25 percent. Provinces and territories have agreed to “cost-share” the program and facilitate implementation; they will be responsible for up to 25 percent of costs, subject to terms of agreements with the federal government. </p>
<p>Commercial landlords will be able to have the loans forgiven as long as they can show they provided a reduction in rent to their tenants. Forgivable loans would be disbursed directly to the mortgage lender.</p>
<p>The CMHC says its is expecting &#8220;a large volume of applications,&#8221; and therefore to manage the volume is asking property owners to register on specific days once the application process has opened. Registration is broken down by province, more details on that can be found <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/finance-and-investing/covid19-cecra-small-business" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. The deadline to apply for CECRA is August 31.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Applications for the Government of Canada&#8217;s Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility (LEEFF) program have opened as of Wednesday.</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Bill Morneau said that applications can be made as of Wednesday morning, through a subsidiary of the Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDEV). CDEV has formed a new subsidiary, Canada Enterprise Emergency Funding Corporation (CEEFC), to administer LEEFF.</p>
<blockquote><p>The financing will be available to companies with significant operations in Canada and annual revenues of more than $300 million.</p></blockquote>
<p>LEEFF, which was <a href="https://betakit.com/government-expands-bcap-announces-covid-19-support-for-canadas-largest-employers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced last week</a>, is set to provide bridge financing to Canada’s largest employers that have been affected by COVID-19. Loans will be provided by CEEFC in cooperation with Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) and the Department of Finance.</p>
<p>The bridge financing will be available to companies with significant operations in Canada, annual revenues of more than $300 million, and requiring a minimum loan size of $60 million. Morneau noted that the idea behind LEEFF is to provide support to large enterprises with credit needs that aren&#8217;t being met through conventional financing options.</p>
<p>LEEFF is available for large for-profit enterprises in all sectors, except for those in the financial sector. According to CEEFC&#8217;s factsheet on LEEFF, certain not-for-profit enterprises, such as airports, could also be eligible for the program but companies that have been found guilty of tax evasion are not eligible.</p>
<p>The federal government is making available loans of $60 million and above, with Morneau adding that the size of the individual loans will be decided on a case-by-case basis based on the companies demonstrating need. Assessments will be based on the applicant’s cash flow needs for the next 12 months.</p>
<p>The loan will be provided as two loan facilities: an unsecured facility equal to 80 percent of the aggregate loan and a secured facility equal to 20 percent of the aggregate loan amount. The loan will be advanced in tranches over a 12 month period. The support will come with an interest rate of 5 percent for the first year, which will be increased to 8 percent in the second year, with a further 2 percent increase each year thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-government-commits-15-million-in-covid-19-support-to-women-entrepreneurs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canadian government commits $15 million in COVID-19 support to women entrepreneurs</a></strong></p>
<p>The duration of the unsecured facility will be five years and the borrower may prepay the loan at any time without penalty. Any companies receiving LEEFF loans are subject to certain requirements including, “strict limits” to dividends, share buy-backs, and executive pay; publishing annual climate-related disclosure reports; and demonstrating how the companies intend to preserve employment and maintain investment activities.</p>
<p>Morneau added on Wednesday that if the borrower is a Canadian public company it must issue warrants with the option to purchase common shares in the company totalling 15 percent of the principal amount of the loan. The warrants, he said, are meant to enable CEEFC to share in the upside of borrowing company&#8217;s recovery. Non-publicly traded companies will be required to provide CEEFC with compensation in the form of additional fees at a comparable value to the warrants for the public company.</p>
<p>The finance minister highlighted that the idea behind providing loans to large businesses is about creating best-case scenarios and to preserve jobs and firms and &#8220;get through these times to what will be the next challenge.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About half of Canadian East Coast startups say they are feeling the financial impact of the COVID-19 crisis, according to a <a href="https://www.concrete.vc/blog/covid-19-survey" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new survey</a> from Halifax-based early-stage venture capital firm <a href="https://www.concrete.vc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Concrete Ventures</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of the East Coast startups surveyed, nearly 16 percent reported laying off staff.</p></blockquote>
<p>The survey heard from 117 respondents, and looked at the economic impact of the crisis as it pertains to fundraising, sales and marketing, and runway for startups in the region. Survey respondents were divided into three categories: pre-revenue, early-stage, and established startups.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 is an unprecedented crisis for startups in Atlantic Canada, as it is for many startups around the world,” said Patrick Hankinson, partner at Concrete Ventures. “For some, this has created new opportunities but others are facing difficult challenges. Yet the East Coast startup community remains resilient. I am confident that we will get through this crisis.”</p>
<p>The survey found that 52 percent of pre-revenue startups, 49 percent of early-stage startups, and 53 percent of established startups indicated they are feeling the impact. This survey was conducted around the same time an April <a href="https://betakit.com/bdc-survey-says-90-percent-of-canadian-entrepreneurs-feel-negative-impact-of-covid/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from the Business Development Bank of Canada found that 90 percent of entrepreneurs across Canada were feeling the impact of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/government-extends-emergency-wage-subsidy-to-end-of-august-to-assess-30-percent-revenue-criteria/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Government extends emergency wage subsidy to end of August, to assess 30 percent revenue criteria</a></strong></p>
<p>Throughout the country, a number of startups have decided to let go of staff due to COVID-19. On the East Coast, nearly 16 percent of respondents reported laying off staff, according to Concrete Ventures’ survey. Of those layoffs, 63 percent came from early-stage startups, 31 percent from pre-revenue startups, and six percent from established startups.</p>
<p>In response to these sudden widespread layoffs, the federal government has made several relief programs available to Canadian businesses. However, Concrete Ventures’ survey found 17 percent of Atlantic Canada startups indicated their business is not eligible for any of these programs. The firm highlighted pre-revenue startups as being particularly “left out” of these programs. </p>
<p>The federal government’s 75 percent wage subsidy, which is aimed to help businesses retain staff, has specific revenue-based eligibility requirements. Although the government <a href="https://betakit.com/feds-work-to-revise-wage-subsidy-but-canadian-tech-says-it-needs-more/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relaxed</a> some of these criteria in early April, some members of the tech community have <a href="https://betakit.com/cci-tells-feds-emergency-wage-subsidy-must-be-expanded-to-support-canadian-tech/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">highlighted</a> that pre-revenue startups would still be ineligible for the program. </p>
<p>The financial impact of COVID-19 has also resulted in many startups <a href="https://betakit.com/loopio-lays-off-11-staff-as-it-sees-increased-scrutiny-from-buyers-during-pandemic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cutting</a> sales and marketing costs during the crisis. Concrete Ventures’ survey found that 73 percent of early-stage and 93 percent of established companies on the East Coast have cut sales and marketing expenses, and noted that these numbers are expected to impact growth over time.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/government-expands-criteria-of-40000-small-business-ceba-loan-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Government expands criteria of $40,000 small business CEBA loan program</a></strong></p>
<p>Concrete Ventures also noted that COVID-19 has dimmed prospects for overall startup growth this year. For pre-revenue startups, 50 percent are expecting flat or declining growth in 2020, compared to 27 percent of early-stage startups and 25 percent of established startups. </p>
<p>“The crisis has also had a significant impact on funding decisions, with many investors moving to bolster their established investments rather than investing in new companies,” Concrete Ventures said. </p>
<p>Seventy-four percent of pre-revenue East Coast startups indicated they have less than nine months of runway compared to 53 percent of early-stage startups and 50 percent of established startups with less than nine months of runway.</p>
<p>“In terms of additional support, the top three requests coming from the survey centre around raising capital, sales [and] marketing, and runway extension,” Concrete Ventures said. “All three of these requests show that entrepreneurs, while optimistic, are still cautious about what lies ahead.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shopify has partnered with Facebook to launch <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/facebook-shops" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook Shops</a>, a free tool aimed to help merchants create customized online storefronts for Facebook and Instagram. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re bringing the tech industry together to help entrepreneurs succeed at a critical time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Facebook Shops allows Shopify merchants to control customization and merchandising for their storefronts inside Facebook and Instagram while managing their products, inventory, orders, and fulfillment directly from within Shopify. Facebook Shops was announced today during a Facebook Live <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10111929914173161/?t=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">event</a> featuring Tobi Lütke, CEO of Shopify, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook. </p>
<p>Shopify has partnered with Facebook since 2015 on its multi-channel e-commerce solution. Shopify is one of several commerce partners on the Facebook Shops initiative. Other partners include BigCommerce, WooCommerce, and ChannelAdvisor.</p>
<p>“What everyone needs right now, especially in this crazy situation&#8230; is new buyers. Small businesses need a way to find new buyers,&#8221; Lütke said on the Facebook Live announcement. &#8220;It’s going to be an incredibly powerful new reality for everyone in the retail space to have these powerful tools built natively in the Facebook platform.”</p>

<p>Through Facebook Shops, consumers will be able to find, browse, and buy products through Facebook and Instagram. Checkout will be powered by Shopify for merchants, with Shopify also offering Instagram Checkout to select merchants testing the new feature.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see Facebook Shops as a natural extension of our relationship,&#8221; Satish Kanwar, vice president of product at Shopify, told BetaKit. &#8220;As businesses adapt to selling online, we believe Facebook Shops will help merchants reach more of their customers and continue to drive sales. Our platform and expertise in commerce, combined with Facebook&#8217;s reach, show how tech companies can come together to help businesses during a tough time.&#8221;</p>

<p>As part of the announcement, Shopify is also launching a new, unified Facebook channel that will let merchants automatically connect their Shopify business to Facebook in one place. The tool is also aimed to make customers’ shopping experience feel native to each individual app. This new channel is available for installation now, and Shopify said it will continue to grow in functionality throughout the year.</p>
<p>“Shopify offers tools that entrepreneurs need to start and run their businesses, and they’re helping a lot of companies move online,&#8221; said Zuckerberg. &#8220;We’re excited to work with them to help small businesses prepare for the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook Shops will become available for all businesses across Facebook and Instagram over the coming months. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that eligibility criteria for Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) has been expanded to include more small businesses.</p>
<p>The CEBA offers interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to small businesses and not-for-profits. The program will now be available to businesses with sole proprietors, those that rely on contractors, and family-owned businesses that pay employees through dividends rather than payroll.</p>
<p>Trudeau highlighted companies such as hair salon owners, independent gyms, and local physio businesses will now be eligible. He added that more details on the expanded criteria will be provided shortly.</p>
<p>The president and CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), Dan Kelly, called this a significant expansion to CEBA.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Very pleased to hear PM <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JustinTrudeau</a> announcing plans for a significant expansion to the CEBA program. This will soon include those paying w dividends, those hiring contractors &amp; those renting chairs (eg. salons). CFIB appreciates that govt has listened to our advice.</p>
<p>&mdash; Dan Kelly (@CFIB) <a href="https://twitter.com/CFIB/status/1262762644521566213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>To qualify under the expanded eligibility criteria, applicants with payroll lower than $20,000 are required to have a business operating account at a participating financial institution; a Canada Revenue Agency business number, and to have filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return; and eligible non-deferrable expenses (such as rent, property taxes, utilities, and insurance) between $40,000 and $1.5 million.</p>
<p>The CEBA is <a href="https://betakit.com/edc-executive-vice-president-on-the-agencys-covid-19-response/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">administered</a> by Export Development Canada (EDC), which works with Canadian financial institutions including banks and credit unions to deliver the loans. The $40,000 loans have zero-interest and are partially forgivable (25 percent) if repaid by December 31, 2022. The CEBA is meant for businesses that have experienced diminished revenues due to COVID-19, and face ongoing non-deferrable costs such as rent, utilities, insurance, taxes, and employment costs.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/banks-open-up-applications-for-40000-interest-free-emergency-business-loans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Banks open up applications for $40,000 interest-free emergency business loans</a></strong></p>
<p>Trudeau said that, to date, more than 600,000 small businesses have accessed the CEBA, which reportedly amounts to more than $24 billion in credit. More details, including the launch date for applications under the new criteria, are set to be provided in the coming days. </p>
<p>The federal government is also working on other &#8220;potential solutions&#8221; around CEBA. The prime minister noted that Minister of Small Business Mary Ng is working to offer support to business owners and entrepreneurs who operate through their personal bank account, as opposed to a business account, or have yet to file a tax return, such as newly created businesses.</p>

<p>In his official statement on today&#8217;s expanded eligibility criteria, Kelly said it is &#8220;encouraging to hear that new businesses and those with personal bank accounts will soon be included through a separate stream of the program.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eight Ontario-based startups developing COVID-19 solutions are set to receive $30,000 in seed funding and $10,000 in business support through the <a href="https://www.acceleratorcentre.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Accelerator Centre</a>’s COVID-19 cohort of its AC <a href="https://www.acceleratorcentre.com/programs/ac-jumpstart" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">JumpStart</a> program.  </p>
<blockquote><p>ApplyBoard, which recently claimed a unicorn valuation, has previously participated in JumpStart.</p></blockquote>
<p>Usually, the AC JumpStart program is aimed at helping tech companies establish and grow their businesses in southern Ontario. This new 10-month COVID-19 cohort is intended to drive business growth in the region to support the province’s pandemic recovery and enable economic expansion following the pandemic.</p>
<p>The funding is intended to help companies accelerate the launch of products and services. The AC JumpStart program is funded by FedDev Ontario and is delivered in partnership with Conestoga College, the University of Guelph, the University of Waterloo, and Wilfrid Laurier University.</p>
<p>“In the fight against COVID-19, we must harness the talents of both our public and private sectors, and it’s inspiring to see so many Canadians mobilizing,” said Minister of Economic Development Melanie Joly. “I want to thank AC JumpStart and the eight companies working with it for making such important contributions to this endeavour.”</p>
<p>The startups receiving funding include:</p>
<p><a href="https://carminadeyoung.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carmina de Young Fashion Design</a>: A sustainable fashion startup that will use the funding to create and distribute reusable isolation gowns.</p>

<p><a href="https://layerci.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LayerCI</a>: A startup developing computer systems testing that will use the funding to increase the speed and efficiency of remote collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/techstars-to-hold-startup-weekend-virtually-as-it-shifts-event-focus-to-covid-19-solutions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Techstars to hold Startup Weekend virtually as it shifts event focus to COVID-19 solutions</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mobistreamsolutions.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MobiStream</a>: An enterprise software company that will use the funding to build “ultra-secure” communication tools to support remote work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theryna.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ryna</a>: A rental platform that will use the new funds to help displaced women find affordable and reliable housing solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sanitationstation.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sanitation Station</a>: A startup that will use the funding to scale its touchless, portable machines that sanitize phones with UV light.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tyltgo.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TyItGo</a>: A delivery platform that will use the funding to offer fast and affordable delivery to retailers while maintaining brand identity.</p>
<p><a href="https://unlearn.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Unlearn</a>: An equity-focused social enterprise that will assist in launching digital initiatives to identify and eliminate discriminatory practises in schools, workplaces and communities.</p>
<p>Former participants in the AC JumpStart program include companies like ApplyBoard, which recently raised <a href="https://betakit.com/applyboard-raises-100-million-cad-claims-2-billion-unicorn-valuation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$100 million</a> and claimed a unicorn valuation. Other participants include NERv Technology, SmartBail, and AlertLabs. A total of 297 participants have received support from the program since it launched in 2015.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost half of Canadian tech companies are reporting having experienced a decrease in company value because of the current global pandemic, according to findings from a new survey conducted by the Council of Canadian Innovators (CCI).</p>
<blockquote><p>Forty-nine percent of those surveyed experienced a decrease in company value directly connected to COVID-19.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the latest survey of CCI members, which consists of some of Canada’s largest tech companies, 49 percent of respondents reported having experienced a decrease in company value, directly connected to COVID-19. </p>
<p>The data is the latest in a series of surveys that CCI has conducted of its hundreds of members during the pandemic, as it looks to understand the state of the Canadian tech sector. Around 307 tech leaders participated in this survey, with CCI providing its findings to the federal government. </p>
<p>While many tech companies have seen a decrease in value, companies operating mainly in healthtech, cloud, remote work, and learning sectors have seen some positive impacts related to the pandemic. Eighteen percent of those surveyed reported an increase in company value. One example of such a company would include ApplyBoard. A CCI member, ApplyBoard recently became the latest Canadian company to <a href="https://betakit.com/applyboard-raises-100-million-cad-claims-2-billion-unicorn-valuation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reach unicorn status</a>, with a $2 billion valuation.</p>
<p>CCI&#8217;s survey results also found that the average workforce decrease across the tech ecosystem was -8.5 percent. Canadian tech companies have continued to make pandemic-related layoffs, even in light of the emergency relief measures undertaken by the federal government to help companies retain workers. In mid-April, the government <a href="https://betakit.com/as-applications-open-here-are-the-details-of-the-new-250-million-covid-19-irap-subsidy-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduced</a> $250 million for an Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP) COVID-19 Innovation Assistance Program (IAP), which offers a wage subsidy more targetted for the tech and innovation community.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/report-number-of-canadian-startups-significantly-impacted-by-covid-19-slightly-higher-than-global-average/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Report: Number of Canadian startups significantly impacted by COVID-19 slightly higher than global average</a></strong></p>
<p>The Canadian tech community had also joined <a href="https://betakit.com/feds-work-to-revise-wage-subsidy-but-canadian-tech-says-it-needs-more/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calls</a> for an expanded Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and when the criteria was <a href="https://betakit.com/federal-governments-75-percent-wage-subsidy-passed-by-senate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">changed</a> in order to be more inclusive of such companies, only 40 percent of CCI members said they may still be ineligible compared to <a href="https://betakit.com/survey-finds-82-percent-of-tech-ceos-plan-to-make-layoffs-after-being-left-out-of-federal-wage-subsidy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">94 percent</a> that said they would be ineligible prior.</p>
<p>However, the government has not seen companies take advantage of the CEWS as had been hoped. According to <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/over-two-weeks-after-launch-ottawas-wage-subsidy-failing-to-attract-businesses-as-expected" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reporting</a> by The National Post, just two weeks after the CEWS was launched, it attracted barely 13 percent of the expected number of applicants. To date, around 132,481 employers have taken advantage of the subsidy for around 1.7 million employees, according to data from the Canada Revenue Agency</p>
<p>Speaking with Canadian tech CEOs that have made personnel changes in the last few weeks, they highlighted to BetaKit not being eligible for federal wage subsidy programs, and in a number of cases, would not commit to plans to rehire employees that had been temporarily laid off.</p>
<blockquote><p>CCI’s latest survey also found that 76 percent of Canadia tech companies say they will need stimulus support after June.</p></blockquote>
<p>CCI&#8217;s latest survey also found that 76 percent of Canadia tech companies say they will need stimulus support after June. Last week, the federal government extended the CEWS <a href="https://betakit.com/government-extends-emergency-wage-subsidy-to-end-of-august-to-assess-30-percent-revenue-criteria/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to the end of August</a> in the hope that more businesses would choose to apply for the program.</p>
<p>According to CCI, Canadian tech leaders say they need more government support. Those surveyed reported speed as an issue in accessing government stimulus programs and also said the government needs to &#8220;step up&#8221; and increase access to strategic capital and procurement opportunities. CCI reported that a lack of new customers is impacting growth in Canada&#8217;s tech sector.</p>
<p>Canadian technology industry association Technation is another group that has urged the federal government to dedicate a “reasonable proportion” of federal recovery funding to be allotted to government procurement and adoption of tech solutions.</p>
<p>Governments at all levels have adjusted procurement policies amid the pandemic to become more responsive, but with a focus on COVID-19. In mid-March, the Government of Canada <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-government-refocuses-innovation-procurement-programs-in-fight-against-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">refocused</a> and opened up its procurement strategy, with <a href="https://betakit.com/what-canadian-provinces-are-doing-to-support-businesses-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provincial government&#8217;s</a> doing much the same. Many Canadian startups have benefited from such programs including <a href="https://betakit.com/canada-commits-192-million-to-covid-19-sif-stream-signs-deal-with-bluedot-to-help-track-make-decisions-on-virus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlueDot</a> and <a href="https://betakit.com/ontario-health-agency-signs-deal-with-canadian-startup-to-more-easily-screen-and-track-covid-19-patients/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">InputHealth</a>.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/report-startups-could-fuel-the-recovery-of-canadas-economy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Report: Startups could fuel the recovery of Canada’s economy</a></strong></p>
<p>Respondents to CCI&#8217;s survey also reported a 37 percent increase in merger and acquisition (M&#038;A) interest around high-growth Canadian companies. While CCI&#8217;s data did not break down where that M&#038;A interest stems from, Suzanne Grant, CEO of the Canadian Advanced Technology Alliance (CATA), previously <a href="https://betakit.com/tech-reaction-mixed-to-increased-scrutiny-on-foreign-investments-as-overseas-buyers-express-interest/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told BetaKit</a> the organization received emails from a foreign company interested in buying a Canadian tech company “inexpensively&#8221; amid the pandemic. CATA had also identified other small companies being bought out by large companies and foreign powers.</p>
<p>In early April, the federal government <a href="https://betakit.com/tech-reaction-mixed-to-increased-scrutiny-on-foreign-investments-as-overseas-buyers-express-interest/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took steps</a> looking to curb such “opportunistic investment behaviour,” as many Canadian businesses experience issues with cash and falling valuations amid the current global crisis.</p>
<p>Many Canadian tech companies have also decreased their global expansion plans due to COVID-19. Forty percent of those surveyed by CCI reported having decreased their expansion plans, with 22 percent seeing an increase. Those positively affected are in sectors such as healthtech, cloud, remote work, and learning</p>
<p>Intellectual property (IP) has also seen a spike amid the pandemic, according to CCI, with 25 percent of companies surveyed increasing IP-related investments, including research and patent filings. The other 75 percent of those surveyed either stayed the course or decreased their IP investments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Government of Canada has committed $15 million in new capital to support women entrepreneurs amid the ongoing economic crisis brought on by COVID-19.</p>
<p>The $15 million comes in the form of additional capital for Women Entrepreneurship Strategy (WES) Ecosystem Fund organizations. The funding will go directly to select organizations that are currently WES Ecosystem Fund recipients. The new investment is meant to help women entrepreneurs across the country navigate the current climate.</p>
<blockquote><p>“COVID-19 has exposed vulnerabilities in our social and economic systems and demonstrated it has a gendered impact.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The government stated the $15 million will help thousands of women entrepreneurs and business owners navigate COVID-19 in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>Minister of Small Business Mary Ng, who is responsible for the <a href="https://betakit.com/government-announces-slew-of-women-entrepreneurship-investments-ahead-of-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WES</a>, provided more details on the $15 million at today&#8217;s noon ministers briefing.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minister noted that the idea is to offer targeted support to organizations that are dedicated to supporting women business owners. The funding will help support business workshops, mentorship opportunities, and skills training to help women entrepreneurs adapt to a digital marketplace, she said.</p>
<p>The WES Ecosystem Fund is one part of the federal government&#8217;s $2 billion Women Entrepreneurship Strategy. The fund invests in organizations that support women entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>The overall WES program also includes the <a href="https://betakit.com/women-led-companies-receiving-first-20-million-cad-of-women-entrepreneurship-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Women Entrepreneurship Fund</a>, which invests in women-led businesses; the Women Entrepreneurship Knowledge Hub, which offers data and best practices for women entrepreneurs; and the WES Expert Panel, which advises on issues around solving gaps in services and supports for women entrepreneurs in Canada.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/the51-atlantic-womens-venture-fund-partner-on-women-focused-venture-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The51, Atlantic Women’s Venture Fund partner on women-focused venture initiative</a></strong> </p>
<p>The government allocated $85 million directly to the <a href="https://betakit.com/three-alberta-based-organizations-receive-3-million-from-wes-ecosystem-fund/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WES Ecosystem Fund</a> as part of the Budget 2018. That capital was divvied up into more than 50 projects led by non-profit organizations that are inclusive of the needs of diverse and under-represented women. Prior to today&#8217;s additional capital, the WES Ecosystem Fund was no longer accepting applications.</p>
<p>Minister Ng highlighted the affect COVID-19 has had on women entrepreneurs, noting, &#8220;women business owners and entrepreneurs are facing unique difficulties during these challenging and uncertain times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;COVID-19 has exposed vulnerabilities in our social and economic systems and demonstrated it has a gendered impact,&#8221; Shannon Pestun, director of Women&#8217;s Entrepreneurship Business at ATB and WES panel member, told BetaKit. &#8220;COVID-19 has revealed women entrepreneurs are particularly vulnerable because of several factors: they tend to run smaller businesses, are less capitalized, and are heavily concentrated in the service sector. On top of that, many women are now shouldering child-care as a result of school closures and elder care in this time of isolation and social distancing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The $15 million for the fund comes after a number of entrepreneurship organizations across Canada urged the federal government to implement support specifically for underrepresented entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://betakit.com/report-reveals-widespread-impact-of-covid-19-on-underrepresented-entrepreneurs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> by the Canadian Women’s Chamber of Commerce (CanWCC) and Dream Legacy Foundation found that 85 percent of underrepresented entrepreneurs reported having lost contracts, customers, or revenue during the crisis.</p>
<p>Along with their report, the two organizations also released <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-groups-urge-governments-to-implement-funding-for-underrepresented-entrepreneurs-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">policy recommendations</a> for all levels of government, calling for emergency funding tailored to the needs of various underrepresented founder groups.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/government-extends-emergency-wage-subsidy-to-end-of-august-to-assess-30-percent-revenue-criteria/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Government extends emergency wage subsidy to end of August, to assess 30 percent revenue criteria</a></strong></p>
<p>According to a Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) <a href="https://www.bdc.ca/en/about/sme_research/pages/changing-face-of-canadian-entrepreneurship.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from 2019, women account for 28 percent of all entrepreneurs in Canada. Other <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/new-research-reveals-canadian-women-entrepreneurs-earn-58-per-cent-less-than-men-690897031.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies</a> show that, on average, these founders earn 58 percent less than their male counterparts. Although women make up 51 percent of the population in Canada, last year, they raised just <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-you-shouldnt-need-to-be-a-man-to-get-venture-capital-funding-in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four percent</a> of venture capital funding available.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Women&#8217;s Entrepreneurship Strategy, a $2 billion dollar investment aims to double the number of women-led companies by 2025. COVID-19 not only jeopardizes this goal, but also threatens to undo many of the advances we&#8217;ve made over the past few years to increase women&#8217;s entrepreneurship in Canada,&#8221; said Pestun. &#8220;It has never been more important to ensure a gender lens is applied to managing the impact of COVID-19 on the Canadian business landscape but on the recovery as well.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calgary-based investment platform <a href="https://the51.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The51</a> and the Atlantic Women’s Venture Fund have created a new initiative that will support and fund women’s ventures across Canada. </p>
<p>The organizations hope the partnership, called Canada51, will become a national collective of organizations and individuals supporting women entrepreneurs in all areas of the country. The initiative is in its early stages and the hope is to develop investment leads, create joint programming, and amplify the voices of women entrepreneurs in Canada.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We expect this structured partnership to expand in a very powerful way, creating a nationwide network effect.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“It’s time for us to invest in what looks like us. At The51, we’ve made a commitment to tap 51 percent of Canada’s capital, innovation, talent, and spending power,” said Shelley Kuipers, co-founder of The51. “We know we can transform Canada’s economy in this decade and beyond and our partnership with [the Atlantic Women’s Venture Fund] is pivotal to stitching this next economic wave together.” </p>
<p>Kuipers told BetaKit the organizations were already in communication with each other “all the time,” through events and general information-sharing, although it was on an informal basis. Canada51 is a formalization of these existing relationships. She added that the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed the importance of strengthening these partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-groups-urge-governments-to-implement-funding-for-underrepresented-entrepreneurs-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canadian groups urge governments to implement funding for underrepresented entrepreneurs amid COVID-19</a></strong></p>
<p>The51 is a platform connecting female angel investors with female-led ventures. The organization was co-founded by Kuipers, Judy Fairburn, and Alice Reimer. Similarly, the Atlantic Women’s Venture Fund’s goal is to get more women investing and more women CEOs receiving investment. It is managed by Rhiannon Davies, Sarah Young, and Cathy Bennett. The Atlantic Women’s Venture Fund is also currently <a href="http://entrevestor.com/blog/canada51-to-back-women-founders" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raising</a> a $20 million fund.</p>
<p>A 2019 <a href="https://betakit.com/new-report-provides-fresh-data-on-familiar-diversity-problems-in-canadian-vc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> found that women comprise 12 percent of partners in Canadian private equity firms, and 11 percent in Canadian venture capital firms. A different <a href="https://betakit.com/bc-report-finds-pronounced-lack-of-women-and-indigenous-leadership-in-tech/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from Minerva BC found just 26 percent of board members in the companies surveyed were women. Although women make up 51 percent of the population in Canada, last year, they raised just <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-you-shouldnt-need-to-be-a-man-to-get-venture-capital-funding-in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four percent</a> of venture capital funding available.</p>
<p>Canada51 said the COVID-19 pandemic has only deepened these existing inequalities, adding that supporting female entrepreneurs is the key to economic recovery.</p>
<p>Kuipers told BetaKit The51 and the Atlantic Women’s Venture Fund do not intend to be founders or owners of the initiative, rather they “have put the stake in the ground” and are now inviting anyone interested to join. </p>
<p>With The51 being a new member of the National Angel Capital Organization (NACO), Kuipers highlighted the national angel group as one organization that could join Canada51. NACO recently launched a women-focused venture <a href="https://builtbyangels.com/news/amanda-filipe-to-lead-national-initiative-for-women-entrepreneurs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initiative</a> of its own, which will be led by new hire Amanda Filipe (formerly of OneEleven). The51 and the Atlantic Women’s Venture Fund were two of the organizations NACO was looking to work with on this initiative.</p>

<p>NACO’s project is aimed to connect female entrepreneurs to angel capital as well as resources. It is also in the early stages and details of what the program would look like are still being finalized.</p>
<p>Kuipers also highlighted the opportunity for various women-focused initiatives, funds, and groups across Canada to participate in Canada51.</p>
<p>“Canada51 is an open partnership of organizations and individuals that firmly believe that there is a tremendous Canadian opportunity for activating women&#8217;s capital and investing in female innovation,” she added. </p>
<p>“We expect this structured partnership to expand in a very powerful way, creating a nationwide network effect,” said Davies. “Embracing organizations and individuals who are actively supporting female innovation and capital, delivering sustainable, profitable and inclusive economic growth at a time when it is needed most.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Canadian Women’s Chamber of Commerce (<a href="https://canwcc.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CanWCC</a>) and <a href="https://torontofoundation.ca/dream_legacy_foundation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dream Legacy Foundation</a> have shared policy recommendations with the provincial and federal governments that could support underrepresented founders during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The recommendations were released along with a survey that heard from entrepreneurs from underrepresented groups across the country, including women, minorities, and business founders with disabilities.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s critical that we don’t use COVID-19 as an excuse to erase the gains we’ve made in business diversity.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://betakit.com/report-reveals-widespread-impact-of-covid-19-on-underrepresented-entrepreneurs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initial results</a> of that survey revealed the broader impact of COVID-19 on these entrepreneurs, with 85 percent of respondents saying they have lost contracts, customers, or revenue during the crisis. The survey findings were used to form recommendations to policymakers.</p>
<p>“We are hearing countless stories of founders’ pain and frustration trying to navigate government and private sector funding since the breakout of COVID-19,” said Danielle Graham, a survey partner, entrepreneur, and investor. “Especially in a purely virtual world, our pre-COVID relationships and networks are even more critical to engaging these underrepresented communities.”</p>
<p>The organizations’ first recommendation is to implement emergency funding for underrepresented entrepreneurs. Eight-five percent of people surveyed reported a loss in contracts, revenues, and customers during the pandemic, with racialized founders reporting the highest percentage of losses at 80 percent.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/report-number-of-canadian-startups-significantly-impacted-by-covid-19-slightly-higher-than-global-average/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Number of Canadian startups significantly impacted by COVID-19 slightly higher than global average</a></strong></p>
<p>CanWCC and Dream Legacy Foundation said this emergency funding should be tailored to each group’s needs and should be administered by “leaders and organizations within each community.”</p>
<p>BetaKit has learned that the federal government is planning to announce emergency COVID-19 measures specifically for women entrepreneurs. A government spokesperson has confirmed to BetaKit that plans for the measure have been finalized, with details expected to be announced shortly.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The narrative right now around business and economic stimulus is very homogenous.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>“There is no time for the government to conduct an ecosystem map or environmental scan to understand the unique needs of each of these groups,” CanWCC and Dream Legacy Foundation said. “Community leaders and organizations have the expertise to navigate these complex ecosystems already.”</p>
<p>The second recommendation is to integrate mental health support into emergency responses. Mental health was consistently reported as one of the top three challenges for founders across the communities surveyed. The report noted that sources of these mental health concerns include financial insecurity, physical health, loss of a loved one, conflict in the home, including domestic violence, loss of social support, and general anxiety about the future. </p>
<p>The organizations said mental health support requires both rapid short-term intervention and long term planning for ongoing care. These supports could include subsidized mental health services, on-call mental health and wellness providers, or a partnership with an online service that provides mental health services. </p>
<p>Some steps towards this have already been taken at the private sector level. For example, the Ontario Psychological Association recently <a href="https://betakit.com/think-research-ontario-psychological-association-partner-to-offer-virtual-mental-health-services/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">partnered</a> with Think Research to provide virtual mental health services in the province.</p>

<p>The report’s third recommendation is to enact universal, subsidized child care. This, the organizations said, would enable women with young children to participate in the labour force in higher numbers, which would positively impact economic growth and productivity.</p>
<p>Spending additional time on care and domestic work was reported as a key challenge for women, Indigenous people, and people living with disabilities or increased accessibility needs, according to the survey.</p>
<p>The report noted that prior to COVID-19, women and girls performed more unpaid domestic and caretaking labour than men, adding that time spent on caretaking and household work means less earning capacity and reduced productivity.</p>
<p>“The narrative right now around business and economic stimulus is very homogenous. It’s critical that we don’t use COVID-19 as an excuse to erase the gains we’ve made in business diversity,” said Nancy Wilson, CEO and founder of CanWCC. “We want every level of government to include the voices and experiences of all business owners when drafting policy and allocating financial support.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital cryptocurrency ecosystem <a href="https://www.kin.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kin</a>, an organization started by Kik, has launched an independent ad network that allows consumers to earn Kin in exchange for viewing advertisements.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have seen the revenue and engagement potential possible with rewarded advertising.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Matthew Hibberd, Kin</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The network would appear to operate as a form of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00197" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incentivized advertising</a>, a format currently used by many mobile entertainment apps, such as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=rMa-XsyeEsGt0PEPmoGCsAQ&#038;q=candycrush+ad+reward&#038;oq=candycrush+ad+reward&#038;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIICCEQFhAdEB4yCAghEBYQHRAeMggIIRAWEB0QHjIICCEQFhAdEB4yCAghEBYQHRAeMggIIRAWEB0QHjIICCEQFhAdEB4yCAghEBYQHRAeMggIIRAWEB0QHjIICCEQFhAdEB46BAgAEEc6BAgAEAo6BAgAEA06BggAEBYQHjoICAAQCBANEB46BwghEAoQoAE6BAghEBVQvvwBWJuIAmCriQJoAHACeACAAX6IAYkFkgEDNS4ymAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&#038;sclient=psy-ab&#038;ved=0ahUKEwjMpIqYqLbpAhXBFjQIHZqAAEYQ4dUDCAw&#038;uact=5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CandyCrush</a>. Kin’s program allows app developers to reward users for viewing ads and create more impressions and awareness for advertisers. Kin said the goal is that this system would generate “real consumer and advertiser demand” for its cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>“We have been thinking about advertising and rewarding users for quite some time, and now is an opportune time to lean in,” said Matthew Hibberd, head of Kin US, in a <a href="https://medium.com/kinblog/kin-ads-a-new-way-for-apps-to-monetize-with-kin-1f00a8daefc9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blog post</a>. “Having been a part of the team that developed Kik Points, I have seen the revenue and engagement potential possible with rewarded advertising.”</p>
<p>Kik Points was a rewards system that allowed Kik users to earn points and receive access to app features like stickers. The program was shut down after Kik decided to make these features free to download in 2017.</p>
<p>Hibberd said that now that over 5.5 million users are earning Kin each month across more than 50 apps, the cryptocurrency has achieved a level of scale that is attractive to advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/kin-launches-5-million-usd-crypto-defence-fund-to-fight-the-sec/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kin launches $5 million USD crypto defence fund to fight the SEC</a></strong></p>
<p>The first developer to roll out Kin’s ad program is MadLipz, a social entertainment app and  2019 alumnus of Techstars Toronto. In 2019, MadLipz <a href="https://betakit.com/techstars-toronto-cohort-company-madlipz-raises-671000-cad/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">integrated</a> Kin cryptocurrency as a rewards mechanism that lets users earn, send, and receive Kin within the app.</p>
<p>Kin began as a cryptocurrency token issued on the public Ethereum blockchain through messaging app Kik. The currency marked a major pivot in Kik’s strategy, after the company faced increased competition from larger social networks like Facebook. </p>
<p>In September, Kik announced that it was <a href="https://betakit.com/kik-chat-app-shuts-down-as-company-goes-all-in-on-kin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shutting down</a> its chat app and reducing its headcount to 19 from more than 200 employees, to focus solely on the Kin cryptocurrency. The announcement came as Kik was preparing to fight the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in court after it raised $157 million CAD through an <a href="https://betakit.com/kik-plans-to-raise-157-million-cad-through-token-distribution-event/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initial coin offering</a>.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of Kik’s shutdown, 51 employees were <a href="https://betakit.com/carta-acquires-kik-team-as-part-of-canadian-expansion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hired</a> by Carta on October 15. The Kik messaging app was <a href="https://betakit.com/kik-app-acquired-by-holding-company-medialab/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired</a> by US-based holding company MediaLab on October 18, one day before it was set to shut down. Kitchener-Waterloo-based Kin is now an entirely separate nonprofit organization that lets app developers integrate the currency into their platform.</p>
<p>“The vision for Kin is to power an economy where everyone is fairly compensated for the value they create online,” said Hibberd. “In order to achieve that, the ecosystem needs to focus on driving real demand for Kin.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the Government of Canada is extending the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) for another three months.</p>
<p>The wage subsidy program will now be available until the end of August. The news comes one week after Trudeau <a href="https://betakit.com/federal-government-extends-75-emergency-wage-subsidy-beyond-june/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that the program was set to be expanded beyond June, though did not provide detail at the time.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy will now be available until the end of August.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trudeau also announced on Friday that over the next month the federal government plans to assess and make any necessary adjustments to the wage subsidy program. He pointed specifically to the 30 percent revenue decline criteria as an area the government plans to look at. &#8220;Meeting a decline shouldn&#8217;t be a barrier to growth&#8221; as businesses begin to re-open, Trudeau said.</p>
<p>During a ministers&#8217; briefing later on Friday, Finance Minister Bill Morneau noted that the new regulations for the CEWS are effective immediately. He also noted that the program is now more open to organizations including tax-exempt indigenous-owned businesses, journalism and amateur sports organizations, as well as partnerships consisting of non-eligible employers as long as those members are not majority owners.</p>
<p>The finance minister noted that extending the CEWS to the end of August is about supporting individual Canadians and giving businesses &#8220;a greater sense of confidence.&#8221; He added that making potential future adjustments to CEWS is meant to encourage employers to hire workers.</p>
<p>Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), called an &#8220;extended and simplified wage subsidy&#8221; an important measure in helping Canadian small businesses.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/here-are-the-final-details-on-the-canada-emergency-wage-subsidy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here are the final details on the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy</a></strong></p>
<p>To date, around 120,000 employers have applied for the CEWS for around 2 million employees. On Friday, Trudeau encouraged employers that have yet to apply to do so given the extended availability.</p>
<p>The CEWS offers a subsidy of 75 percent of an eligible employee’s weekly earnings, to a maximum of $847 per employee per week to eligible employers, for up to 12 weeks. The funding is retroactive to March 15 and will now be available until the end of August.</p>
<p>Since the wage subsidy program was <a href="https://betakit.com/morneau-provides-more-detail-on-governments-75-percent-wage-subsidy-for-canadian-businesses/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched</a>, members of the Canadian startup and tech community have <a href="https://betakit.com/feds-work-to-revise-wage-subsidy-but-canadian-tech-says-it-needs-more/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticized</a> the federal program’s revenue criteria. Originally, the CEWS required a 30 percent year-over-year revenue decline for each of the three months that it was available. That criteria was later <a href="https://betakit.com/federal-governments-75-percent-wage-subsidy-passed-by-senate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relaxed</a> to a 15 percent revenue decline for March and opened up the opportunity to compare revenue to January and February 2020 rather than a year-over-year.</p>
<p>A survey conducted by the Council of Canadian Innovators found the expanded criteria passed by Parliament in early April could allow more startups to access the subsidy. The survey found that nearly 40 percent could be ineligible for the wage subsidy, compared to <a href="https://betakit.com/survey-finds-82-percent-of-tech-ceos-plan-to-make-layoffs-after-being-left-out-of-federal-wage-subsidy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">94 percent</a> of companies that said they would be ineligible prior to the expanded criteria.</p>
<p>Even since the CEWS offered expanded criteria, the Canadian tech sector <a href="https://betakit.com/ada-support-lays-off-23-percent-of-staff-amid-uncertainty-caused-by-pandemic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">continued</a> to <a href="https://betakit.com/intersect-ceo-departs-company-following-recent-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">see</a> companies making pandemic-related <a href="https://betakit.com/loopio-lays-off-11-staff-as-it-sees-increased-scrutiny-from-buyers-during-pandemic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">layoffs</a>. CEOs that BetaKit spoke with noted not being eligible for the program and in a number of cases would not commit to plans to rehire employees that had been temporarily laid off.</p>
<p>Responding to a question on Friday on whether the CEWS has helped companies re-hire employees at the rate the government had hoped, Trudeau noted that companies are still facing uncertainty and &#8220;trying to juggle&#8221; various factors that &#8220;they have very little window into.&#8221; He emphasized the plan over the next month to work with industry as well as labour relations and stakeholder groups &#8220;to get it right.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/government-to-expedite-approvals-for-temporary-foreign-workers-during-covid-19-pandemic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Government to expedite approvals for temporary foreign workers during COVID-19 pandemic</a></strong></p>
<p>Kelly stated the CFIB is also happy to hear the government is open to changes to the CEWS requirement to demonstrate a 30 percent drop in gross revenue. He noted that the test &#8220;is one of the reasons the take up of the program has been far less than expected&#8221; and emphasized it could cause &#8220;a particular problem&#8221; as the Canadian economy moves to the recovery phase. </p>
<p>Morneau stated that he believes the extensions will give employers a greater sense of confidence and more employers will decide that the program is &#8220;appropriate&#8221; for their businesses.</p>
<p>The prime minister also announced on Friday $450 million to help researchers and institutions, including those associated with universities and health research institutions. The funding is meant to help those groups that have been affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19 to maintain salaries and essential research-related activities. The government will provide a wage subsidy of up to 75 percent per individual, with a maximum of $847 per week. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (<a href="https://www.cifar.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CIFAR</a>) is launching 14 projects through a new grant program focused on research that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to fight COVID-19. </p>
<p>Launched in March, the program will provide nearly $300,000 in total funding to “innovative, high-risk, high-reward” ideas and projects that address the current outbreak. The program is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Ontario government, Microsoft, and Genome Canada.</p>
<blockquote><p>“These grants represent a critical opportunity for interdisciplinary researchers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Our government is exploring every opportunity including critical AI research to combat COVID-19 and to contribute to the worldwide knowledge base on this virus,” said Ross Romano, Ontario’s minister of colleges and universities. “This new virus requires innovative ways of thinking and solving problems.”</p>
<p>The projects are expected to be completed within three months to a year, and will explore a range of topics that leverage AI. Collaborators include researchers from academic organizations like the Vector Institute, Mila, and a number of Canadian universities. </p>
<p>These CIFAR-backed projects are among many initiated by Canada’s AI ecosystem intended to help Canada overcome the pandemic. In the private sector, startups like <a href="https://betakit.com/element-ai-creates-platform-to-help-researchers-identify-patterns-in-covid-19-research/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Element AI</a>, <a href="https://betakit.com/darwinai-university-of-waterloo-develop-neural-network-for-covid-19-detection/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DarwinAI</a>, and <a href="https://betakit.com/health-canada-expedites-approval-of-1qbit-chest-radiography-ai-tool-to-help-fight-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1QBit</a> have launched solutions to help researchers better understand and track the virus and its impact. Scale.AI, Canada’s AI-focused supercluster, also recently announced it would <a href="https://betakit.com/alayacare-dialogue-among-projects-receiving-3-4-million-from-scale-ai-supercluster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fund</a> a number of new projects that address COVID-19. </p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/vector-institute-repurposing-ai-infrastructure-to-support-ontarios-covid-19-health-data-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vector Institute repurposing AI infrastructure to support Ontario’s COVID-19 health data project</a></strong></p>
<p>The 14 CIFAR projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>PanXcea: A pandemic prediction tool that uses X-Ray-based analysis</li>
<li>MyTrace: A privacy-compliant contact-tracing mobile app for COVID-19.</li>
<li>COVIDEX: A project that uses biomedical knowledge graphs for COVID-19 drug repurposing strategies.</li>
<li>COVID-Net: An open-source deep learning platform for COVID-19 detection and risk stratification.</li>
<li>A tracing project that will track the genetic history of SARS-CoV-2, the strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19.</li>
<li>A study that will model the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between animals on a genetic level.</li>
<li>A study that will detect and monitor pneumonia in COVID-19 patients using machine learning and ultrasound imaging.</li>
<li>A project aimed to accelerate small molecule drug discovery.</li>
<li>A project focused on safeguarding at-risk demographics with AI.</li>
<li>A study intended to identify and validate drug repurposing candidates to treat COVID-19, using AI.</li>
<li>A child and family study that will explore how to prevent COVID-19 infection in families.</li>
<li>Research that will track mental health during the pandemic.</li>
<li>A study that demonstrates how existing software tools can be used to automate parts of infectious disease control policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>“These grants represent a critical opportunity for interdisciplinary researchers to collaborate on solutions that will support Canadians in their return to everyday life,” said Alejandro Adem, president of NSERC. “We are thrilled to partner with CIFAR on this forward-thinking initiative.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.getmovesapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moves</a>, a Toronto-based FinTech startup, has expedited the planned launch of its platform in order to offer loans to gig economy workers, such as ridesharing drivers and food couriers, during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<blockquote><p>“We hear the growing number of people working independently&#8230; are facing challenges resulting from COVID-19.”<br />
<em>&#8211; Matthew Spoke, CEO of Moves</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The startup, which planned to launch in the Fall, is now offering $2,500 one-year loans, which are intended to be used as a “financial bridge to the post-COVID-19 economy” and support independent workers in Ontario that traditional banks and credit scores may disqualify from financial services. </p>
<p>Data from <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/191216/dq191216d-eng.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Statistics Canada</a> indicates that in 2016, there were about 1.7 million workers in Canada’s gig economy. The estimated annual income of a typical gig worker was generally low, Statistics Canada found, with the median net gig income in 2016 totalling $4,300. </p>
<p>Recently, some gig workers have expressed <a href="https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/gig-economy-workers-hit-hardest-covid-19-crisis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concern</a> about the current economic crisis given that many do not have employment insurance benefits even as demand for their services <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/gig-workers-hardest-hit-coronavirus-pandemic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declines</a>.</p>
<p>“We hear the growing number of people working independently for Uber, Lyft, and other app platforms are facing challenges resulting from COVID-19,” said Matthew Spoke, Moves’ CEO. “We know they work hard and face high barriers when trying to access credit from the traditional banks.”</p>
<p>“Moves wants to be their trusted partner to provide accessible and affordable credit to help them bridge to the post-COVID-19 economy and meet their financial goals,” Spoke added.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/facedrive-looks-to-acquire-foodora-canada-assets-as-it-launches-food-delivery-service/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facedrive looks to acquire Foodora Canada assets as it launches food delivery service</a></strong></p>
<p>The $2,500 loans will not require any payments for 12 weeks, after which Moves will withdraw payments of $70 per week for 40 weeks as well as a $220 fee, for a total payback amount of $2,720. The startup said it does not rely on traditional credit checks and that loans will have no impact on credit scores. </p>
<p>The startup is currently accepting applications from Ontario workers that drive or deliver for DoorDash, Facedrive, Instacart, Hiride, Lyft, Skip The Dishes, Uber, Uber Eats, and Foodora. Applicants must have received income from a rideshare or food courier platform in the last 90 days to qualify for the loan, which means Foodora workers could still qualify for the loan, even though the company recently <a href="https://betakit.com/foodora-to-cease-operations-in-canada-citing-highly-saturated-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ceased</a> operations in Canada.</p>
<p>Moves plans to introduce an app in the coming weeks and to expand its flexible cash borrowing solution across Canada. Moves is also planning to make a smaller loan option available. This $500 loan would be repaid either over a four-week period or a one-year period. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Atlantic Canada-based Ocean Supercluster has launched a nationwide call for proposals for a new program aimed to stimulate the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Continuing to encourage investments in innovative solutions has never been more important.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Through the <a href="https://oceansupercluster.ca/projects/accelerated-ocean-solutions-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Accelerated Ocean Solutions Program</a>, the supercluster will invest up to $35 million in short-term ocean projects that will help the sector stay resilient during the crisis. The program is aimed to trigger additional industry investment in innovation and capability-building in Canada’s ocean sector.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://oceansupercluster.ca/projects/accelerated-ocean-solutions-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">application</a> process is now open and begins with expressions of interest which will close on May 22.</p>
<p>“While we remain focused on staying healthy and safe, it’s incumbent upon us to also create opportunities to continue to deliver commercial outcomes and contribute to Canada’s economic recovery,” said CEO of the Ocean Supercluster Kendra MacDonald. “As we look to new opportunities in [the] ocean to help grow the economy post-COVID-19, continuing to encourage investments in innovative solutions has never been more important.”</p>

<p>The Accelerated Ocean Solutions Program is focused on three project themes: remote operations, environment technologies, and digital or automated technologies. The supercluster will consider four types of projects: a product or service advancement and commercialization, capacity and infrastructure, process enhancement, and innovation ecosystem. </p>
<p>The supercluster is <a href="http://loads/2020/05/2020-Accelerated-Ocean-Solutions-Program-Call-For-Proposals.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">looking</a> for projects that have a “compelling strategy” to capitalize on opportunities and overcome current market challenges and operational conditions, and deliver a definitive outcome in an accelerated time frame.</p>
<p>In March, the federal government <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-government-refocuses-innovation-procurement-programs-in-fight-against-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">refocused</a> several of its innovation programs to help in the fight against COVID-19. As part of this refocusing, the government asked the superclusters to tap into their networks to help companies commercialize products more quickly.</p>
<p>The Ocean Supercluster received $153 million from the federal government in late 2018, and since then, has begun rolling out and funding projects. Other superclusters include the Digital Technology Supercluster, the Protein Industries Supercluster, the Manufacturing Supercluster, and the Scale AI Supercluster.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Canada Supercluster is expected to create over 3,000 jobs and contribute more than $14 billion to Canada’s economy over a 10-year period.</p>

<p>In February, the supercluster <a href="https://betakit.com/ocean-supercluster-launches-project-to-support-atlantic-canada-startups/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched</a> a project aimed to revive rural and small communities in the Atlantic Canada region. The supercluster said programs like these are separate from the Accelerated Ocean Solutions Program.</p>
<p>The supercluster has also implemented several measures during the pandemic, including new options to support its members and provide financial relief, such as contributions of up to $50,000 for eligible project development costs, project advances, and reducing costs for industry members.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The federal government has implemented a temporary <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2020/05/government-announces-help-for-employers-to-meet-their-labour-needs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">policy</a> aimed at reducing the time it takes for a temporary foreign worker to start a new job in Canada. The policy was announced by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) on Tuesday. </p>
<blockquote><p>“This is great news for those Global Talent Stream workers who were laid off.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The move is aimed to help employers that have ongoing labour needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The policy is applicable to foreign workers in a number of industries, including those in the tech sector, that may have lost work due to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>“This is great news for those Global Talent Stream (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/global-talent/requirements.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GTS</a>) workers who were laid off,” co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.globalskills.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Global Skills Hub</a> Yousuf Khatib told BetaKit. “[We continue] to be impressed by IRCC&#8217;s empathetic and rapid response to ensuring the promises we made as tech companies and a country to welcome immigrants to Canada is kept.”</p>
<p>The GTS is a federal government program intended to help companies quickly access international high-skilled talent that is otherwise unavailable in Canada. Through the GTS, the government reduces the processing time of immigration applications to two weeks, with a $1,000 fee paid by the employer to the government.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/federal-governments-updated-work-sharing-program-could-help-startups-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal government’s updated work-sharing program more open to startups amid COVID-19</a></strong> </p>
<p>The new temporary policy, which Khatib lobbied the federal government for, allows individuals who have been laid off and have applied for a new work permit to start working in the new job almost immediately while they wait for their permit to receive approval. The update policy cuts a 10-week process down to 10 days or fewer.</p>
<p>Khatib said this will help employers fill labour shortages more quickly and help immigrants begin working faster. He noted that the new policy doesn’t change any existing rules on requirements and eligibility for work permits, rather, it compresses approval timelines. </p>
<p>Temporary foreign workers, including workers already in Canada, are <a href="https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=168&#038;top=17" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">required</a> to acquire their permit at a border or other port of entry. Travel restrictions imposed during the pandemic mean foreign workers looking for work have been unable to acquire a permit at a port of entry. These restrictions also meant employers, such as tech startups, were therefore also unable to fill open positions before this temporary federal policy was implemented.</p>
<p>According to the federal government, this new policy would apply to workers who are already in Canada, have secured a new job offer, and can get approval to start working in their new job, even while their work permit <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/visitors-foreign-workers-students.html#change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">application</a> is being processed. </p>

<p>Global Skills Hub, a Toronto-based organization that helps Canadian businesses find and hire international talent, is currently creating a list of GTS workers who have been affected by the pandemic. In partnership with Prospect, Global Skills Hub has also launched an <a href="https://airtable.com/shrmtI6y1Ntq5o8zL" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">online forum</a> to provide up-to-date information on the outbreak pertaining to GTS workers.</p>
<p>“Immigrants, temporary foreign workers and international students are making considerable contributions to Canada’s response to the unprecedented challenge that COVID-19 poses,” said Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Marco Mendicino. </p>
<p>“The new policy we are announcing will allow Canadian businesses to recruit the workers they need and help unemployed workers contribute to the Canadian economy during this pandemic,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>London, Ont.-based Facedrive has signed a binding term sheet that could see the ridesharing startup purchase certain assets of food delivery company Foodora Canada, which recently <a href="https://betakit.com/foodora-to-cease-operations-in-canada-citing-highly-saturated-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ceased operations</a> in Canada.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This provides an incredible growth opportunity to broaden our geographic, user and technological base globally.”<br />
<em> &#8211; Sayan Navaratnam, Facedrive</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Following Foodora’s announcement that it was leaving Canada, Foodora Canada began bankruptcy proceedings at the end of April, declaring a <a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/2020/04/29/foodora-declares-bankruptcy-in-canada-leaving-47-million-in-debt.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$4.7 million CAD</a> debt owed to both restaurants and creditors. The company officially ceased operations on May 11.</p>
<p>Under the conditions of the binding term sheet, Facedrive would gain access to 5,500 restaurant partners previously served by Foodora Canada, as well as to Foodora Canada’s customers, the latter being subject to customer consent.</p>
<p>The purchase is not yet final. Following a negotiation of the purchase agreement and court approval, Facedrive said it expects the transaction to close within 45 days. Facedrive added, “[there] can be no assurances that the transaction will be completed on the terms set forth in the term sheet, or at all.” </p>
<p>Facedrive, which touts itself as the first Canadian peer-to-peer, eco-friendly, and socially responsible ride-sharing network, aims to offset carbon emissions by planting trees and giving riders a choice between electric vehicles, hybrids, and conventional vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/ritual-city-of-toronto-partner-to-provide-free-ordering-tool-to-local-foodservice-businesses/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ritual, City of Toronto partner to provide free ordering tool to local foodservice businesses</a></strong></p>
<p>Facedrive has been <a href="https://betakit.com/heres-how-cdntech-companies-are-pitching-in-during-the-covid-19-outbreak/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expanding</a> into new verticals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The startup recently launched Facedrive Foods, a food delivery platform connecting residents to restaurant businesses.</p>
<p>Facedrive noted its Foods platform was created specifically with the intention to support residents, businesses, and drivers during the pandemic. The startup has waived fees for restaurants while the platform is being piloted in Toronto and London. </p>
<p>“The term sheet with Foodora Canada comes at the perfect time for Facedrive,” said Facedrive chairman and CEO Sayan Navaratnam. “The launch of Facedrive Foods is rooted in Facedrive’s vision of becoming the one-stop-shop platform for eco-conscious and socially responsible users.”</p>
<p>Other recent Facedrive initiatives include a medical supplies delivery service, a contact tracing app, and a marketplace featuring sustainably sourced products and services. The news also follows several weeks after Facedrive <a href="https://betakit.com/toronto-rideshare-company-facedrive-to-acquire-hiride/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired</a> the entirety of HiRide, a ride-sharing and car-pooling app.</p>

<p>“A full ecosystem with rideshare, delivery, entertainment, gamification, and social components, all in a single platform, is the epitome of convenience with the huge added bonus of being green,” added Navaratnam. “This provides an incredible growth opportunity to broaden our geographic, user, and technological base globally.”</p>
<p>Foodora Canada cited a “highly saturated market” as reasons for its departure. However, the announcement came two months after Foodora Canada’s Toronto workers were granted the right to unionize by the provincial labour board.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/2020/04/29/foodora-declares-bankruptcy-in-canada-leaving-47-million-in-debt.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reporting</a> by the Toronto Star, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers filed a complaint to the provincial labour board alleging that Foodora was exiting the country because it wants to “defeat a union organizing drive.”</p>
<p>Foodora Canada began as Hurrier, a Toronto-based startup, that was acquired by Rocket Internet-owned Foodora in 2016 and later rebranded. The service was available in 10 Canadian cities before it pulled out of the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five Atlantic Canada-based tech startups have been selected to receive $25,000 each as part of the Volta Cohort pitch competition held on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The five startups will also be joining Volta&#8217;s <a href="https://betakit.com/volta-accepting-applications-for-spring-2020-cohort/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spring cohort</a>. Fifteen startups took part in the pitch night, which was held virtually.</p>
<blockquote><p>“As we move beyond the two-year pilot and work toward a new normal, we’re excited to see how this program will continue to grow.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The $25,000 investment is done through a microfund co-founded by Volta, BDC Capital, Innovacorp, and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA). Along with the funding, the companies will also receive mentorship entrepreneurs, as well as various resources to grow their businesses as part of the Volta Cohort program.</p>
<p>“Companies selected to participate in the Volta Cohort program continue to outperform when it comes to job creation, rapid growth, and raising venture capital investments,&#8221; said Martha Casey, COO and interim CEO of Volta following the <a href="https://betakit.com/jesse-rodgers-out-as-ceo-of-atlantic-canada-hub-volta/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">departure</a> of former CEO Jesse Rodgers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their impact and ambition – especially in uncertain times such as this – remind us of the importance of remaining agile in order to persevere,” added Casey. “As we move beyond the two-year pilot and work toward a new normal, we’re excited to see how this program will continue to grow, and to support these startups as they reach global markets and scale.”</p>
<p>The companies joining the next Volta Cohort include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>KorrAI, (Halifax, NS)</strong> is an artificial intelligence platform with domain expertise-led learning to improve the operational efficiency of industrial systems.</li>
<li><strong>Kute Lab, (St. John’s, NFLD)</strong> is creating a platform to offer a mobile application that simplifies cosmetics ingredients, as well as provide market assessment to beauty manufactures.</li>
<li><strong>SmartMed, (Halifax, NS)</strong> has created SmartShift, a tool that helps auto-schedule 800 shift positions in one minute.</li>
<li><strong>Habit Forming Technologies, (Halifax, NS)</strong> is creating JackHabbit is a growth management system using persuasive technology, sentiment analysis, human interaction, and more, to provide an individualized solution that combines physical and mental health together under the umbrella of behavioural science.

					<description><![CDATA[Ripple Ventures, a Toronto-based early-stage venture firm, has made an initial close of $14 million CAD ($10 million USD) for its new Opportunity Fund....]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple Ventures, a Toronto-based early-stage venture firm, has made an initial close of $14 million CAD ($10 million USD) for its new Opportunity Fund.</p>
<p>Investors in the fund include return, family office investors from Ripple’s first fund, such as the Kimel Family. The initial close also included new “strategic investors,” Round13 Capital, JDF Capital Partners, Bluesky Equities, Coinsquare co-founder and CEO Cole Diamond, and several family offices including the Belz Family Office.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The impetus for this fund now was because our investors were adamant about investing while the market was dislocated.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt Cohen, Ripple’s founder and managing partner, told BetaKit the firm plans to increase the size of the fund, though would not disclose a target. He said the Opportunity Fund will be “adding investors in the coming months.”</p>
<p>Through the new fund, Ripple plans to invest in companies at the seed and early stages of their growth, with a focus on companies based in Toronto, Waterloo, Montreal, New York, and Boston. Continuing its thesis of investing in B2B software, the Opportunity Fund will invest in companies with annual recurring revenue of $500,000 or more.</p>
<p>Cohen explained to BetaKit that the firm had plans to raise a Fund II in 2020 before the economic impact of COVID-19 hit. Then, in early February, its Fund I investors encouraged Ripple to fast track that process and develop the Opportunity Fund.</p>
<p>“The impetus for this fund now was because our investors were adamant about investing while the market was dislocated,” Cohen said, noting their desire to fund early-stage companies in need of bridge financing to help them get through these tough times.</p>
<p>Plans to develop the Opportunity Fund began in February and were closed within a month, said Cohen.</p>

<p>There are various types of opportunity funds, one typical reason for such a fund is when a firm seems an &#8216;opportunity&#8217; to invest in late-stage rounds of existing portfolio companies. This is not the case for Ripple’s new fund. The VC firm plans to make new investments through the fund, but decided to call it the Opportunity Fund “given the opportunity with COVID,” Cohen told BetaKit.</p>
<p>“We didn&#8217;t want to call it Fund II, because we weren&#8217;t really raising a full Fund II. And our Fund II was going to be much larger than this initial close was,” the co-founder said. “Our investors are the ones who basically said, ‘we think you should take advantage of the opportunity in the market by helping companies.’”</p>
<p>For its Fund I, which <a href="https://betakit.com/early-stage-fund-ripple-ventures-launches-with-10-million/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed</a> $10 million in 2018, Ripple focused on pre-seed and seed-stage companies. Cohen said the thesis behind the Opportunity Fund is much the same as Fund I, with the main difference being the new fund will invest in companies that are looking for what he called “seed to seed-plus” funding to help bridge to a Series A.</p>
<p>“It’s no secret that companies of all sizes and industries are feeling the pressure from the global crisis,” Cohen told BetaKit. “Even the best companies are looking for infusions of capital to strengthen their balance sheets or sustain their businesses.”</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/backed-by-shopify-co-founder-scott-lake-risc-capital-launches-new-early-stage-fund-focused-on-deep-tech/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Backed by Shopify co-founder Scott Lake, RiSC Capital launches new early-stage fund focused on deep tech</a></strong></p>
<p>“More than ever, founders are looking for partners to act as a lighthouse and guide them through this storm,” he added. “We are looking to leverage this fund to support Seed-stage startups who have proven products and are looking to capitalize in this environment.”</p>
<p>Ripple looks to work closely alongside its portfolio companies. Following the close of its Fund I, the firm launched a Toronto-based incubator, which it calls ‘The Tank.’ With a portfolio of early-stage ventures, Cohen explained that its companies are used to remote work and were able to easily transition to the new social-distancing reality.</p>
<p>The Opportunity Fund will invest between $1 million to $2 million USD for up to 10 companies over the next year and a half. The fund already has its first investment, Rose Rocket, a Toronto-based transportation management software platform for the trucking industry.</p>
<p>Given the shift in the world due to COVID-19, we’ve seen fundamental changes in how startups need to adjust to the new startup reality,” said Cohen. “There are new long-term opportunities in markets previously unseen before as a result of this pandemic.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.benevity.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Benevity</a>, a startup that offers corporate social responsibility and employee engagement software, has announced that Steven Woods, co-founder of Nudge.AI, will be joining its executive team as chief technology officer.</p>
<blockquote><p>Woods was the co-founder and CTO of Nudge.AI, which shut down in January.</p></blockquote>
<p>Woods will be based in Toronto and will officially join Calgary-headquartered Benevity on June 1. He replaces Benevity co-founder Jason Becker, who served as interim CTO for seven months during the search for a permanent replacement. Becker will remain at the company as vice president of architecture.</p>
<p>As CTO, Woods will be responsible for leading Benevity’s technology team, which includes more than 200 development, product management, analytics, and enterprise platform professionals across Benevity’s offices in Calgary, Victoria, and Toronto.</p>
<p>“Steve is a seasoned CTO who is not only a brilliant technologist but has also managed successfully through the growth and maturation stages of SaaS companies that will be valuable to Benevity as we continue to scale and innovate our market-leading products and technology,” said Bryan de Lottinville, Benevity’s founder and CEO.</p>
<p>Woods brings over two decades of executive experience in developing ideas into mass-market products. Most recently, Woods co-founded and was CTO of Toronto-based Nudge.AI, an autonomous deal intelligence layer for customer relationship management. Nudge.AI <a href="https://betakit.com/toronto-startup-nudge-ai-is-shutting-down/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shut down</a> in January and its assets were <a href="https://betakit.com/nudge-ai-assets-acquired-less-than-two-months-after-company-shut-down/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired</a> less than two months later.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/calgary-tech-companies-unite-to-draw-in-more-entrepreneurial-talent/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Calgary tech companies unite to draw in more entrepreneurial talent</a></strong></p>
<p>Woods co-founded Nudge.AI alongside Paul Teshima. The pair previously co-founded Eloqua, which grew to more than $100 million in annual revenue, IPO’ed on the NASDAQ, and was eventually <a href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oracle-buys-eloqua-122012.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired</a> by Oracle. Woods served as CTO at Eloqua where he led technology operations for 14 years.</p>
<p>Benevity was founded in 2008 as a platform that enables companies to engage their employees and customers around social responsibility and community investment, hoping to create better business and social impacts. The startup, which is one of the largest startups in the Prairies, raised a <a href="https://betakit.com/calgary-based-benevity-raises-40-million-in-series-c/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$40 million</a> Series C in October. </p>
<p>Woods’ arrival at the Calgary-founded startup follows several senior technology hires, including vice president of engineering John Mortimer who joined the team in September and vice president of product Grant Bryce who started in November.</p>
<p>“Over the past few years, it’s been made abundantly clear why companies should be prioritizing purpose alongside profit,” said Woods. “As this concept mainstreams, I look forward to contributing my skills in helping Benevity continue to drive market leadership and growth, while helping the company realize its moonshot of ‘infusing a culture of goodness into the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toronto-based <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wattpad</a> is launching two film projects that are part of a new fund aimed to finance and kickstart the early production stages of select TV and film projects originally penned by Wattpad’s writer community. </p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re expanding our investment in early-stage development, adapting incredible stories for new formats.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Wattpad Development Fund will use the company’s data-backed insights to discover stories and trends from its platform that can be adapted. The development fund will finance the early stages of that production, including screenwriting, casting, and onboarding a director. Once the project is kickstarted, Wattpad will then work with a studio to move the projects into production.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wattpad said by increasing investment in early development, it can fast-track stories for screen to create more success with audiences. The fund will also allow the company to bring up-and-coming Wattpad stories to viewers.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/wattpad-partnership-with-penguin-random-house-marks-first-expansion-into-europe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wattpad Books partnership with Penguin Random House marks first expansion into Europe</a></strong></p>
<p>Kiel Hume, Wattpad’s communications lead, told BetaKit the company intends to work on two productions per year. Wattpad financed the fund internally and refused to disclose its size.</p>
<p>The company called the development fund its latest attempt to “verticalize” the business. Hume explained the idea as finding new opportunities and formats to tell stories written by Wattpad’s writers. Wattpad has also verticalized through its publishing subsidiary, <a href="https://books.wattpad.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wattpad Books</a>, as well as its <a href="https://betakit.com/wattpad-launches-paid-content-program-in-the-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paid content</a> program. Hume said this fund will allow the company to tap into a third opportunity to showcase Wattpad stories.</p>
<p>“With these new film projects, we’re expanding our investment in early-stage development, adapting incredible stories for new formats and helping them find new fans everywhere,” said Aron Levitz, head of <a href="http://business.wattpad.com/studios/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wattpad Studios</a>.</p>
<p>Wattpad typically works with a number of studios around the world to produce films and television shows. The company currently has about 50 productions in development. In September, the company <a href="https://betakit.com/wattpad-inks-first-major-deal-in-latin-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">partnered</a> with Wise Entertainment in Latin America and has inked major deals and projects with partners in North America, Europe, and Asia.</p>

<p>Hume told BetaKit that films and shows developed from the new fund will not affect Wattpad’s existing productions or partnerships. </p>
<p>“Our partners all program for their specific goals, so when we help them find new content, we&#8217;re always looking for specific types of genres or stories that match their needs,” Hume said. “With our development fund, we&#8217;re looking at amazing stories that just don&#8217;t fit with what our partners are looking for in one way or another.”</p>
<p>The two projects currently being developed through the fund are titled The Hound and What Happened That Night. The Hound is a suspense and horror story that will be adapted by screenwriter Angela LaManna. What Happened That Night is a thriller and coming-of-age story that will be adapted by Academy Award-nominated screenwriter David Arata.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toronto Mayor John Tory is set to announce a partnership between the City and food ordering and mobile pickup startup <a href="https://www.ritual.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ritual</a>, to provide a tool aimed to help local businesses grow sales during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s important to us that we help our hometown businesses get up and running while keeping Torontonians safe.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The tool, called <a href="https://www.ritual.co/partners" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ritual ONE</a>, provides foodservice businesses, including restaurants, grocers, butchers, and bakeries with a way to accept digital orders from their own website and social media accounts. Ritual ONE offers businesses the option for takeout or delivery, contactless ordering, and an automated loyalty program. The startup typically offers the ordering tool at a cost.</p>
<p>Through the initiative with the City of Toronto, businesses that sign up before June 1 will receive a lifetime exemption from both commission and subscription fees for Ritual ONE (as long as the business is located in an area where Ritual operates). Usually, the Ritual ONE monthly subscription fee costs $49.99 per month.</p>
<p>“As a Toronto-based company, it’s important to us that we help our hometown businesses get up and running while keeping Torontonians safe during this time,” said Ray Reddy, co-founder and CEO of Ritual. </p>
<p>James Rilett, vice president of Central Canada for Restaurants Canada, a national association representing Canada&#8217;s foodservice industry, said initiatives like this one being undertaken by the City and Ritual are necessary to help restaurants recover from the effects of COVID-19.</p>
<p>“We believe local restaurants are what make communities thrive, and we are here to support them as we work with Mayor Tory and the City of Toronto to help kickstart our economy again,” Reddy added.</p>
<p>This initiative is a part of the City’s short-term economic support and recovery <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/home/covid-19/covid-19-economic-support-recovery-for-businesses/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plan</a>. Businesses enrolled in the ShopHERE program will also be eligible for Ritual ONE in addition to the lifetime exemption from commission and subscription fees. <a href="https://betakit.com/city-leading-toronto-tech-initiative-to-get-local-small-businesses-online/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Launched</a> by the City on Monday, ShopHERE is a multi-partner initiative that aims to build 3,000 online stores for Toronto independent businesses.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/tech-entrepreneurs-launch-donation-platform-to-help-canadian-local-businesses-affected-by-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tech entrepreneurs launch donation platform to help Canadian local businesses affected by COVID-19</a></strong></p>
<p>Businesses that use Ritual ONE will also receive a dedicated expert to support them during the onboarding process. This offer is also available to existing restaurants in the Ritual marketplace. </p>
<p>Restaurants have been particularly hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent data collected by Ipsos indicates that about <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/Covid-19-Devastates-Canadian-Foodservice-Sales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">26 percent</a> of Canadian restaurants won’t have the funds to re-open when the pandemic is over. As many restaurants have been forced to offer their services via delivery apps, some owners are arguing that the commission charged by these delivery apps is <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/restaurant-owners-say-delivery-apps-are-taking-too-much-commission-during-covid-19-pandemic-1.5531773" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">too high</a>, given the current climate.</p>
<p>Ritual touts its current offering, which eliminates commission and subscription fees, as a way to minimize the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the local economy.  </p>
<p>The Toronto-headquartered startup has experienced its own challenges during the pandemic. Ritual heavily promotes its service to companies and workers, so when restaurants closed and its primary customer base began to work from home, the business ultimately took a hit. Last month, Ritual <a href="https://betakit.com/ritual-cuts-staff-in-half-reduces-operations-due-to-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">laid off</a> more than half of its employees and scaled back operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vancouver-based &#x200d;<a href="https://zivadynamics.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ziva Dynamics</a>, a startup that develops character simulation software for the film and entertainment industry, has raised a $9.8 million CAD ($7 million USD) seed round. This is the first round of venture financing for the company.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ziva’s tool has been used by over 100 studios on titles such as Game of Thrones and Captain Marvel.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The round was led by <a href="https://www.grishinrobotics.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grishin Robotics</a>, <a href="https://toyota-ai.ventures/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Toyota AI Ventures</a>, and Millennium Technology Value Partners’ <a href="http://mtvlp.com/newhorizons/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New Horizons Fund</a>. The financing will be used to make key hires, advance the research and development of Ziva’s digital character generator, and expand the company’s sales and marketing efforts.</p>
<p>“Our biomechanics, soft tissue, and machine learning technologies are finally intersecting with the optimization of game consoles, enabling us to introduce the highest quality characters to a space that is constantly pushing for better, faster results,” co-founders of Ziva Dynamics James Jacobs and Jernej Barbic said in a joint statement. </p>
<p>“With our new partners and funding, we’ll be able to double our R&#038;D spend, accelerate productization, and play a defining role in the most advanced graphics experiences,” they added.</p>
<p>Ziva’s technology is designed to bring physics-embedded soft tissue simulation to the media and entertainment industry through machine learning and biomechanics. Artists can use Ziva’s tool to quickly produce computer-generated characters with muscles, fat, and skin, that automatically move as they would in real life. </p>

<p>Jacobs has been <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/canadian-earns-oscar-for-digitally-created-characters-1.1344126" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recognized</a> by the Academy Awards for his work in digitally creating characters and Barbic is an associate professor of computer science at the University of Southern California. Ziva’s character authoring tool has already been used by over 100 studios on titles such as Game of Thrones, The Meg, and Captain Marvel. </p>
<p>The startup was founded in 2015 and took <a href="https://betakit.com/edvisor-ziva-dynamics-change-heroes-top-bcic-new-ventures-competition/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">second place</a> at the 2013 New Ventures Competition, which is hosted by New Ventures BC and the BC Innovation Council.</p>
<p>Ziva said the investment has already allowed the company to hire new talent to accelerate software development, and increase adoption by video game studios. The startup is developing open architecture and real-time platforms, which are separate from the character authoring offering. Those newer developments are scheduled for public release later this year.</p>
<p>“James and Jernej are making a big impact on the film industry with their cutting-edge 3D character technology,” said Dmitry Grishin, founding partner at Grishin Robotics. “We are big believers in the convergence of film, animation and online gaming content and are very excited to partner with Ziva in building industry-standard character creation software for the rapidly growing digital entertainment universe.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul Crowe, CEO of Intersect, a Toronto-based software development firm, is stepping down from his role at the company. The news closely follows the termination of 19 Intersect employees.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It takes an incredibly exciting opportunity to pull me away from something I love so much.”<br />
<em> &#8211; Paul Crowe, outgoing CEO of Intersect</em><br />
&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Crowe is leaving Intersect after more than nine years with the company. He announced the move via LinkedIn on Monday, stating “this week will be my last week at Intersect.” </p>
<p>The outgoing CEO confirmed the change to BetaKit, explaining that his decision to leave Intersect had been “in the works for a while.” He added that he will be sharing details on his new role in the coming weeks. In the LinkedIn post, Crowe said, “it takes an incredibly exciting opportunity to pull me away from something I love so much.”</p>
<p>Intersect’s vice president of growth and partnerships, Anthony Lipkin, and Chris Hirst, director of product management, will step in to lead Intersect following Crowe’s departure.</p>
<p>Crowe’s announcement follows one week after he publicly revealed layoffs at Intersect, also via LinkedIn. Nineteen employees spanning various departments were laid off, representing approximately 11 percent of the company, which currently sits at 160 employees per Intersect’s LinkedIn profile. BetaKit has reached out to Intersect to confirm whether the layoffs were permanent or temporary and if the decision was directly related to COVID-19. The company did not provide comment before time of publication.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009 as BNOTIONS, Intersect creates custom software for organizations in a variety of sectors. BNOTIONS was <a href="https://betakit.com/bnotions-acquired-by-symbility-solutions-for-5-million/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired</a> in 2015 by Symbility Solutions, a Toronto-based insurance claims software vendor, which rebranded the company to Intersect. In early 2019, Symbility Solutions was <a href="https://betakit.com/corelogics-acquisition-of-symbility-complete/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired</a> by global real-estate data company CoreLogic. The move made Intersect a wholly-owned subsidiary of CoreLogic.</p>
<p>Intersect helps its parent company, as well as other businesses, create digital products. Some of its clients include major brands such as American Express, TD Bank, Mastercard, Johnson &#038; Johnson, and Facebook.</p>
<p>Crowe called his time with Intersect “an incredible journey.” </p>
<p>“This journey included being acquired twice, designing and building software used by millions of people around the world, ending up in board rooms and offices that I only dreamt about, and visiting parts of the world I probably wouldn’t have seen or discovered if I hadn’t taken the risk to join a few crazy guys at a company called bnotions in 2011,” he said on LinkedIn.</p>

<p>Crowe became chief marketing officer of Symbility Solutions after the 2015 acquisition, and also maintained his role as CEO in Intersect. According to his LinkedIn profile, he worked closely with the property and health divisions of Symbility Solutions, which was <a href="https://www.symbilitysolutions.com/media/news-releases/symbility-solutions-completes-agreement-to-sell-its-symbility-health-division/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sold</a> to Telus in 2018. Crowe also oversaw marketing in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. His role at Symbility Solutions came to an end when it was acquired by CoreLogic.</p>
<p>“I am proud of the strength of the team I’m leaving behind and confident that Intersect’s brightest days, best products, and most challenging projects are in its future,” Crowe stated via the LinkedIn post about his departure.</p>
<p>Intersect’s recently laid-off employees were from a variety of departments, including engineering, product management, marketing, and recruiting. On social media, Crowe said those that were let go “a goldmine of talented, caring, and experienced people,” and called on companies that are currently hiring in the tech and product space to consider the laid-off Intersect staff.</p>
<p>While BetaKit has yet to confirm if Intersect&#8217;s decision to layoff staff was directly related to the current pandemic, the company joins a number of others that have had to make <a href="https://betakit.com/ritual-cuts-staff-in-half-reduces-operations-due-to-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">personnel</a> cuts amid COVID-19.</p>
<p>In mid-March, fellow Toronto-based development agency Rangle.io was one of the first Candian tech companies to reportedly make the decision to temporarily <a href="https://betakit.com/rangle-temporarily-lays-off-78-employees-as-financial-pressures-from-pandemic-hit-cdntech/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lay off</a> employees because of COVID-19. The layoffs represented around 30 percent of the company and followed pre-COVID layoffs of approximately <a href="https://betakit.com/rangle-makes-second-significant-staff-reduction-in-less-than-a-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">40 employees</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) and Export Development Canada (EDC) are offering new programs to support medium-sized businesses under the expanded Business...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Business Development Bank of Canada (<a href="https://www.bdc.ca/en/pages/home.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BDC</a>) and Export Development Canada (<a href="https://www.edc.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EDC</a>) are offering new programs to support medium-sized businesses under the expanded Business Credit Availability Program (BCAP).</p>
<p>On Monday, the BCAP was <a href="https://betakit.com/government-expands-bcap-announces-covid-19-support-for-canadas-largest-employers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expanded</a> by the federal government to help mid-sized companies with larger financing needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The BCAP was initially aimed at primarily supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). </p>
<p>These medium-sized business supports are in addition to measures already included in the BCAP, that will continue to be offered to SMEs, alongside other COVID-19 relief measures through <a href="https://www.bdc.ca/en/pages/special-support.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BDC</a> and <a href="https://www.edc.ca/en/covid-19-business-resources.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EDC</a>.</p>
<p>Under expanded criteria, EDC and BDC will cut larger cheques for medium-sized businesses whose credit needs exceed what is already available through the BCAP. Specifically, BDC will offer loans ranging between $12.5 million and $60 million each. EDC’s new loan guarantees will range in size from $16.75 million to $80 million each.</p>
<h3>BDC expands co-lending program</h3>
<p>To support medium-sized businesses, BDC has launched the <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/bdc-to-provide-new-support-for-medium-sized-companies-to-help-navigate-covid-19-as-part-of-government-of-canada-s-business-credit-availability-program-bcap--822779346.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mid-Market Financing Program</a>. The development bank will make additional credit available to complement businesses&#8217; existing debt facilities. Loans will be issued through the businesses’ primary lenders. </p>
<p>Qualifying companies for the Mid-Market Financing Program must have been financially stable and viable prior to the current economic downturn. BDC said it “anticipates” that eligible companies for this new program will have annual revenues more than $100 million. BDC will be offering loans between $12.5 million and $60 million each. </p>

<p>The agency said program details are still being finalized and that additional information will be made available in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current situation is putting pressure on all business owners, big and small. With this additional support, medium-sized companies will be able to maintain their staff, preserve supply chains, and manage cash flow,” said Michael Denham, president and CEO of BDC. “We understand it will take time for both the economy and Canada&#8217;s businesses to stabilize and this new financing program is designed to serve as a bridge through this crisis.”</p>
<h3>EDC expands loan guarantee</h3>
<p>Under the expanded BCAP, <a href="https://www.edc.ca/en/about-us/newsroom/edc-coronavirus-medium-sized-support.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">loans</a> from EDC will range in size from $16.75 million to $80 million. EDC will work with Canadian financial institutions to guarantee 75 percent of new operating credit and cash-flow loans for medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>EDC said its portion of the expanded BCAP program aims to bring liquidity to companies “that tend to have” revenues ranging between $50 million and $300 million. These expanded guarantees will be available to exporters, international investors, and businesses that sell their products or services in Canada.</p>

<p>EDC said the details are still being finalized and will be released in early June. </p>
<p>“Medium-sized companies represent 16 percent of employment in Canada and span all sectors. They are essential to the economic wellbeing of our country,” said Mairead Lavery, president and CEO of EDC. “Not only do they employ millions of dedicated Canadian workers, but they are essential to the livelihood of our industries, supply chains, and our communities.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Details on the <a href="https://betakit.com/federal-government-commits-962-million-to-regional-development-agencies-community-futures-network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently committed</a> $962 million in new capital to Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) and the Community Futures Network were revealed Wednesday.</p>
<p>The program, called the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund (RRRF), was originally announced mid-April, though few details were shared on how the funding would be doled out to the six RDAs across Canada. The almost $1 billion in new capital is meant to support regional and rural businesses that may not have existing relationships with financial institutions, or don’t qualify for other <a href="https://betakit.com/federal-government-extends-75-emergency-wage-subsidy-beyond-june/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal relief programs</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The RRRF is meant to help these businesses and organizations continue operations as well as pay their employees.</p></blockquote>
<p>The RRRF is meant to help these businesses and organizations continue operations as well as pay their employees. It is also available for projects by businesses, organizations, and communities to help prepare for a successful recovery. The fund is open to businesses in sectors that include manufacturing, technology, tourism, and &#8220;others that are key to the regions and local economies.&#8221; </p>
<p>On Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau noted that businesses that did not qualify for Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) and Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) relief programs should reach out to their respective RDA for support. The government added that businesses and organizations that have applied for but were unable to access existing programs are encouraged to review the RRRF eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>Minister of Economic Development Mélanie Joly, who is responsible for the RDAs, encouraged companies including startups in the tech space to reach out to their respective RDAs during a press briefing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The funding is broken down into $675 million for RDAs with $287 million for Community Futures Network (with the network funding distributed through RDAs).</p>

<p>Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD) has been allocated the largest portion of the almost $1 billion fund, with $304.2 million. This is followed by the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev), which is set to receive $252.4 million.</p>
<p>The RDA for Quebec, Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions (CED), is receiving $211 million, with CanNor to receive a total of $34.3 million for territorial businesses. Atlantic Canada&#8217;s ACOA has been allocated $110 million, with the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario (FedNor) receiving $49.5 million.</p>
<p>Each individual agency has been tasked with allocating the money based on the needs of their regions. They will also be responsible for distributing the Community Futures Network portion of the fund to the respective network groups in their region.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://betakit.com/minister-joly-says-details-on-rda-funding-expected-soon-discusses-federal-support-of-tech-sector/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent interview</a> with Betakit, Joly noted the role the agencies play in supporting regional incubators as well. Recognizing the <a href="https://betakit.com/oneeleven-asks-startups-for-abated-rent-then-retracts-claiming-misunderstanding/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent closure</a> of Toronto incubator OneEleven, Joly noted at the time that “getting more funding through our incubators was key to make sure we keep that ecosystem very strong.” Wednesday&#8217;s announcement did not specify whether incubators will be able to access the RRRF.</p>

<p>Joly also said the government will be looking to partner with other organizations that can help support areas where RDAs are less present. The minister said this could include working with “third parties” such as economic development agencies “to make sure that we’re much more present in the Toronto area, and the Montreal area, and big cities.”</p>
<p>Since the onset of COVID-19, RDAs have also adjusted certain criteria for their regular programs. Beginning April 1, businesses have been able to defer their payments for current contribution agreements with their RDA for three months.</p>
<p>Other supports from RDAs include the Northern Business Relief Fund, through the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency (CanNor). The relief fund provides eligible territorial SMEs affected by the economic disruptions with non-repayable grants ranging from $2,500 to a maximum of $100,000. The funding will cover a maximum period of four months and is retroactive to April 1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toronto-based B2B SaaS startup <a href="https://www.loopio.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loopio</a> has permanently laid off 11 members of its staff, which represents eight percent of the company. </p>
<p>In an interview with BetaKit, CEO Zakir Hemraj said the layoffs affected employees in sales, marketing, software development, and people operations.  He attributed the decision to the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When it comes to purchasing new software, conversations generally have slowed down.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“We&#8217;re seeing levels of scrutiny from buyers in all industries that we haven&#8217;t really seen in the last decade,” Hemraj told BetaKit. “So when it comes to purchasing new software, conversations generally have slowed down [with regard] to actually making the decisions on writing a cheque and buying a new piece of software.”</p>
<p>Loopio currently works with over 800 companies in a variety of industries, including healthcare, financial services, and telecommunications. Targeted to enterprises, the platform streamlines responses to requests for proposals, requests for information, and due diligence questionnaires. </p>
<p>The startup has raised one <a href="https://betakit.com/loopio-raises-11-million-to-help-enterprises-streamline-the-rfp-process/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$11 million</a> round of financing since it was founded in 2014, which Hemraj called a testament to the “resiliency” of the business before the pandemic. He noted that once COVID-19 began to have an impact on the economy and the industries it serves, Loopio saw a “slowdown in conversations” and “deferring of purchasing decisions.”</p>
<p>When asked if Loopio had seen a decline in sales, Hemraj told BetaKit the company “faced similar challenges that a lot of B2B software companies [have]”, adding that deals are being “pushed out” while prospective customers are orienting themselves based on the current business environment.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/as-sales-return-careguide-looks-to-rehire-furloughed-staff-following-covid-19-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As sales return, CareGuide looks to rehire furloughed staff following COVID-19 layoffs</a></strong></p>
<p>This led to a change in plans from Loopio’s go-to-market strategy, in addition to how it would grow its team over the year.</p>
<p>“It became clear that our plans for the future needed to change in terms of our goals, as well as our hiring priorities,” the CEO told BetaKit. </p>
<p>Hemraj said he believes this slowdown is temporary, claiming demand and interest in Loopio’s product continues to be high and customer retention has been better in the last fiscal quarter than in the previous year.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of interesting signs of resilience there,” he noted. “But I think the economic impact is the driver of our change in plans, and we&#8217;ve seen this across most B2B software companies and our peers in the industry.”</p>
<p>The government has introduced several relief measures for Canadian businesses facing a cash crunch during the pandemic, including the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and the National Research Council of Canada’s $250 million IRAP COVID-19 <a href="https://betakit.com/as-applications-open-here-are-the-details-of-the-new-250-million-covid-19-irap-subsidy-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Innovation Assistance Program</a>.</p>

<p>Loopio is currently investigating its eligibility for government relief programs and the CEO told BetaKit the company plans to apply for the CEWS. When asked if any relief funds would be used to rehire some of the laid-off employees, Hemraj said he “could not definitively say yes or no.”</p>
<p>Hemraj also would not disclose whether Loopio’s leadership team has or plans to take a pay cut.</p>
<p>“Capital preservation is top of mind for every single company right now [in] this climate, so whatever support we can get, we will try to get that support,” he said. </p>
<p>“When we think about the culture of our company, it&#8217;s important that every single person that is part of the team has the opportunity to make an impact at a high level. If they are in a position where the demand for their work is not there, then that&#8217;s not fair to them and that&#8217;s not fair to us as a business.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>EdTech company <a href="https://tophat.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Top Hat</a> is restructuring internally to adapt to changes in the higher education sector brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company has shifted some employees to digital content and enterprise sales and has permanently laid off 16 members of its revenue team.</p>
<blockquote><p>“A regular growth year doesn&#8217;t make sense for us to do anymore.”<br />
<em>-Mike Silagadze, Top Hat</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Twenty-eight employees were moved from outbound sales roles in order to focus on digital content and enterprise institutional sales. The layoffs represent three percent of the company’s total headcount. The 16 employees who were laid off were all full-time revenue department staff that Top Hat said would not fit into different roles. </p>
<p>The layoffs and restructuring come three months after Top Hat raised a <a href="https://betakit.com/top-hat-raises-72-million-cad-series-d-inks-deals-to-disrupt-the-textbook-industry/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$72 million</a> Series D.</p>
<p>“The changes we are making are a reflection on how our business has changed and the need to shift our go-to-market strategy,” Dianna Lai Read, Top Hat’s director of communications, told BetaKit.</p>
<p>CEO Mike Silagadze explained that the higher education space has changed as a result of COVID-19 in ways that impact Top Hat’s business. Top Hat is not restructuring to cut costs, he said, rather it is adapting to ensure that the business continues to succeed in the changing education sector.</p>

<p>Top Hat typically sells its end-to-end teaching platform directly to university professors, the company’s core customer segment. Normally in March and April, Top Hat focuses on driving the adoption of its platform for the Fall semester. Silagadze told BetaKit the company has run into challenges in reaching professors during COVID-19.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The changes we are making are a reflection on how our business has changed and the need to shift our go-to-market strategy.&#8221;<br />
<em>&#8211; Dianna Read, Top Hat</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Because of this, the company has directed its efforts away from selling and toward <a href="https://betakit.com/top-hat-launches-free-version-of-platform-as-universities-move-to-online-learning/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helping professors</a> finish out the winter term, which was disrupted by the pandemic. </p>
<p>Not being able to successfully conduct outreach to its main customer base was a key part of the reason Top Hat decided to restructure. Silagadze confirmed that all of the laid-off employees were previously focused on outreach to professors.</p>
<p>The company did not directly respond to questions about whether sales had experienced a decline because of the inability to connect with its core customer base, but Read said “it hasn’t been a typical few months,” and reiterated that the company’s recent focus has not been on selling.</p>
<p>“A regular growth year doesn&#8217;t make sense for us to do anymore,” Silagadze told BetaKit. “We&#8217;ve got folks that were spending most of their time calling professors, trying to get them on the phone. The effort we&#8217;re putting into that doesn&#8217;t make sense. We needed to reduce that aspect of it.”</p>
<p>Top Hat recently released the results of a <a href="https://tophat.com/blog/adrift-in-a-pandemic-survey-infographic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> that found seven percent of university students said they wouldn’t return to school in the Fall if the term would be online only. Silagadze said because enrollment represents a big chunk of revenue for universities, this could lead to cost-cutting, which could also, in turn, affect Top Hat’s business.</p>
<p>“In terms of affordability and the university experience, we&#8217;ve seen data &#8230; that shows students have concerns about the online learning experience that they&#8217;re going to get this Fall. The expectation is enrollments are going to decline,” Silagadze told BetaKit. “That obviously impacts Top Hat.”</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/report-number-of-canadian-startups-significantly-impacted-by-covid-19-slightly-higher-than-global-average/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Number of Canadian startups significantly impacted by COVID-19 slightly higher than global average</a></strong></p>
<p>The way Top Hat sells its teaching platform is also changing. Tech adoption at schools is becoming more centralized at the administrative level, Read told BetaKit, which she said also made reaching professors difficult.</p>
<p>While the company has encountered challenges with initiating customer engagement from its end, Read noted that Top Hat is seeing increased inbound interest from professors and administrators.</p>
<p>Silagadze told BetaKit Top Hat has also seen other business lines, such as its digital textbook, accelerate substantially since the onset of the pandemic. The company is reporting that publisher partnerships have also ramped up. Silagadze claimed that Top Hat has also played an important role in helping universities make the transition to online learning since the virus began to spread in North America.</p>
<p>As part of Top Hat’s restructuring, it is also hiring more employees for its product and engineering department. The company hopes to grow that team by 20 percent in order to build new product functionality to support online education. Some of these newer features include a <a href="https://tophat.com/press-releases/top-hat-partners-with-proctorio/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">virtual proctoring tool</a> to help professors conduct remote testing and exams. The virtual tool was launched at the beginning of April, in addition to a free version of Top Hat’s platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barry Bisson, CEO of <a href="https://www.propelict.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Propel ICT</a>, is retiring from his role at the New Brunswick-based online accelerator after three years at the organization. </p>
<p>Bisson joined Propel in 2017 and will conclude his term by October 31 as he transitions to retirement. Propel hopes to have the role filled by this summer. </p>
<blockquote><p>The announcement of Bisson’s departure comes on the heels of Propel’s virtual demo day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Propel has established a search committee to find the organization’s next CEO in partnership with executive search firm <a href="https://chapmangroupcan.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chapman Group</a>. The organization is hoping to attract a “diverse group of applicants” to select a candidate that can lead Propel’s growth and operations.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have been exceptionally lucky to have Barry lead our team over the past three years. His knowledge in scaling tech companies and managing our stakeholder relationships has helped Propel become a leading virtual accelerator for ICT ventures,” said Propel’s board chair Jeff White. </p>
<p>“We have a significant opportunity to grow our impact on the economy and much-needed economic recovery as we engage and support more companies than ever before,” he added.</p>
<p>After he joined Propel in 2017, Bisson launched the <a href="https://betakit.com/propel-opens-applications-for-2020-incite-accelerator-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Incite</a> program, a 12-month, entirely virtual accelerator program that features online and interactive components including one-on-one sessions, live online meetups, and curated content to help founders grow their businesses.</p>
<p>Bisson previously served as the head of Shad Valley International. He was also the head of the technology, management, and entrepreneurship program at the University of New Brunswick.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/jesse-rodgers-out-as-ceo-of-atlantic-canada-hub-volta/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jesse Rodgers out as CEO of Atlantic Canada hub Volta</a></strong></p>
<p>The announcement of Bisson’s departure comes on the heels of Propel’s demo day, which showcased nine companies. Propel graduates <a href="https://yourtotaliq.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Total IQ</a>, <a href="https://www.invisible-agents.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Invisible Agents</a>, <a href="https://septicsitter.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SepticSitter</a>, <a href="https://www.carecrew.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Care Crew</a>, <a href="https://union.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Union.Dev</a>, <a href="https://oliverpos.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oliver POS</a>, <a href="https://joinfoodbyte.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Foodbyte</a>, <a href="https://www.milkmoovement.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Milk Moovement</a>, and <a href="https://simbi.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Simbi</a> presented their business ventures during a virtual showcase on May 8. </p>
<p>Traditionally, Propel has held its wrap-up event in person, but was forced to switch to a virtual presentation as a result of COVID-19. Having run their accelerator virtually for the last two years the transition to a virtual event made sense and allowed more participants to join regardless of their location.</p>
<p>During the virtual demo day, the Gerry Pond Sales Award was presented to St. John&#8217;s-based Oliver POS, which has developed a point of sale plugin for WordPress stores. The criteria for winning the cash prize is revenue growth, customer growth, and demonstrated ability to push leads effectively through the funnel. </p>
<p>“These companies have worked extremely hard to prepare their presentations and get themselves ready for investment in this changing environment,” said Bisson. “It is a testament to both the quality and tenacity of these founders. We at Propel are incredibly proud of their progress and accomplishments during their time in our accelerator.”</p>
<p>In April, Propel announced its transition to a <a href="https://betakit.com/atlantic-canadas-propel-accelerator-shifts-to-continuous-intake-model/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">continuous intake</a> model, where startups can begin the accelerator program at a time when they need it instead of waiting for the next cohort-based intake. The organization is actively looking for new tech ventures to <a href="https://www.propelict.com/apply" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">participate</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Columbia’s innovation commissioner has released his <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/final_ic_report_2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">final report</a> on how the provincial government can help BC tech, and support innovation across all of the province’s sectors. </p>
<p>Alan Winter, who is the province’s first innovation commissioner, completed his two-year term with the Government of British Columbia on February 4. This report is his final one to Michelle Mungall, minister of jobs, economic development, and competitiveness, on his observations on the innovation sector in the province. Winter made five recommendations to the government.</p>
<blockquote><p>Winter acknowledged that BC’s federal funding has not been leveraged in a significant way.</p></blockquote>
<p>“My recommendations are focused on helping to grow BC companies and are intended to be affordable, actionable in the short term, and reflect the advice I have heard repeatedly,” Winter said.</p>
<p>The first recommendation is to fund the establishment and operation of “innovation precincts” across the province. He refers to precincts as “physical places, predominantly centrally located within a community that help foster cross-sectoral innovation and organically grow talent and commercial development.” Winter used MaRS Discovery District in Toronto as an example of an innovation precinct. </p>
<p>“While there is currently no precinct on the scale of MaRS here, there could be,” Winter said in his report, adding that an innovation precinct could be established at St. Paul’s hospital campus which would be focused on health research and development. </p>
<p>Notably, Winter acknowledged that BC’s federal funding, from sources such as the federal <a href="https://betakit.com/federal-government-opens-fifth-stream-of-strategic-innovation-fund/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Strategic Investment Fund</a>, has “not been leveraged in a significant way,” and that the province has made limited investments in innovation precincts. </p>
<p><strong>RELATED:<a href="https://betakit.com/british-columbias-2020-budget-lacks-new-spending-for-tech-and-innovation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> British Columbia’s 2020 budget lacks new spending for tech and innovation</a></strong></p>
<p>Last year, the BC Tech Association was <a href="https://wearebctech.com/bc-tech-cube-announcement/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unable</a> to secure provincial or federal funding to enable the Cube, an augmented reality and virtual reality community hub, to remain open. </p>
<p>Other leading members of BC’s tech sector have also expressed concern over the lack of innovation hubs in the province. One entrepreneur and CEO BetaKit spoke with on background expressed frustration with the province’s lack of support for local hubs, accelerators, and incubators.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve been forced to be entrepreneurial,” the person told BetaKit. “We’ve never had a lot of government support. I think there are going to be some serious problems down the road if people don&#8217;t address it.”</p>
<p>As government support has <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-cut-adrift-bcs-tech-sector-sees-government-support-dry-up/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dwindled</a> for some local innovation hubs, the province has <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020JEDC0002-000158" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">touted</a> the influx of large tech companies to BC, such as Shopify and Amazon <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-to-open-first-permanent-office-in-vancouver-hire-1000-employees/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opening</a> large offices in the city. </p>
<p>Winter’s second recommendation is to support the development of “emerging technology clusters,” which would differ from precincts as they would be geographically connected groups working together in a particular field.</p>
<blockquote><p>Winter also recommended the province support the development of “emerging technology clusters.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Winter highlighted that BC could develop clusters in <a href="https://betakit.com/tech-for-good-fusion-genomics-uses-quantum-computing-to-eliminate-undiagnosed-illnesses/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quantum computing</a>, artificial intelligence, genomics, or augmented and virtual reality. The province is already establishing partnerships within some of these verticals, such as a proposed <a href="https://betakit.com/sfu-gets-17-million-from-bc-government-to-establish-quantum-research-institute/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">innovation corridor</a> between Surrey and Vancouver focused on quantum computing.</p>
<p>Vancouver is among the ecosystems to watch for artificial intelligence development, according to last year’s Startup Genome <a href="https://betakit.com/startup-genome-report-finds-cleantech-life-sciences-ai-canadian-cities-global-stage/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>. BC is also home to startups like <a href="https://betakit.com/d-wave-launches-quantum-application-environment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">D-Wave</a> and <a href="https://betakit.com/health-canada-expedites-approval-of-1qbit-chest-radiography-ai-tool-to-help-fight-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1QBit</a>, focused on advancing quantum computing research, and startups like Form and Archiact, which are bringing AR and VR products to market. </p>
<p>“The province of BC should work with the federal government to catalyze, align, and co-fund key provincial cluster priority areas which would leverage dollars available from several sources such as the federal Strategic Investment Fund,” Winter said. </p>
<p>Winter’s third recommendation is to use the <a href="https://cleanbc.gov.bc.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CleanBC Plan</a> as an economic driver. The plan, announced in 2018, is aimed at reducing climate pollution, while creating jobs and economic opportunities. Last year, Startup Genome <a href="https://betakit.com/startup-genome-report-finds-cleantech-life-sciences-ai-canadian-cities-global-stage/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">listed</a> Vancouver as an ecosystem to watch for cleantech, referencing companies like Terramera and Carbon Engineering as companies that have experienced notable growth.</p>
<p>“The province’s CleanBC plan sets out a good climate vision and brand but the opportunity exists to use the strategy to drive further economic growth in BC,” Winter said, recommending the provincial government incentivize companies to seek out BC solutions when working to meet its climate targets and regulations. </p>
<p>Winter’s fourth recommendation is to encourage the creation of and protect intellectual property (IP). Winter noted that some of the province’s main challenges in this area include IP leakage, a poor incentive structure, the cost of patents, and relatively low levels of business investment in research and development.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/sfu-gets-17-million-from-bc-government-to-establish-quantum-research-institute/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SFU gets $17 million from BC government to establish quantum research institute</a></strong></p>
<p>The outgoing innovation commissioner recommended the government provide matching funding to BC-based small and medium enterprises to assist them in seeking patent protection. He said this, along with tax incentives for income related to the sale of patented products, could encourage companies to increase IP activity within the province. </p>
<p>Winter’s final recommendation is to “invest in leadership talent development strategies.” He said although BC has a highly skilled and talented workforce, the province lacks experienced leaders who can scale and grow companies.</p>
<p>“As a result, BC firms are at higher risk of acquisition by larger companies based in other jurisdictions,” he said. “Government should &#8230; [develop] mentorship and leadership skills across the province, incorporating them as a key component of precincts, and as a means to supporting local companies’ growth.”</p>

<p>The partnership comes as COVID-19 has emphasized the need for access to virtual care. iA Financial Group insurance clients will have access to Dialogue’s telemedicine platform, which provides benefits specifically tailored to large organizations. Clients whose group insurance plan includes supplemental health insurance will receive a preferred rate to add Dialogue to their plan.</p>
<blockquote><p>The partnership is the latest in a string of deals between Dialogue and Canadian insurance providers. </p></blockquote>
<p>Organizations that commit to offering Dialogue for at least 12 months will get the platform free of charge until July 31.</p>
<p>The partnership is the latest in a string of deals between Dialogue and Canadian insurance providers. In April, the Montréal startup partnered with <a href="https://betakit.com/dialogue-enters-partnership-with-sun-life-to-offer-virtual-healthcare/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sun Life Financial</a> and in March entered into a similar partnership with <a href="https://betakit.com/dialogue-partners-with-insurer-canada-life-to-offer-virtual-healthcare-benefits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canada Life</a>, making virtual healthcare a standard benefit for employers with Canada Life group benefits plans.</p>
<p>Jean-Nicolas Guillemette, COO of Dialogue called the iA Financial deal a “strategic partnership” that is “a key step toward achieving our ambition of helping Canadians be more healthy.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Dialogue <a href="https://betakit.com/dialogue-evolves-product-with-the-acquisition-of-german-health-services-company/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired</a> Argumed Consulting Group, a German-based Occupational Health and Safety services company. In December, Dialogue partnered with Doctor On Demand to give enterprise clients the ability to offer virtual healthcare to employees visiting the US. Last year also saw Dialogue close a <a href="https://betakit.com/telehealth-startup-dialogue-raises-40-million-to-fuel-european-expansion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$40 million</a> funding round in order to fuel a European expansion.</p>

<p>Amid COVID-19, Dialogue has taken its own steps to support individuals looking to access virtual healthcare services. In early March, the startup launched a free tool to give Canadian access to the latest public health information and resources pertaining to the virus.</p>
<p>Dialogue recently received an investment of <a href="https://betakit.com/alayacare-dialogue-among-projects-receiving-3-4-million-from-scale-ai-supercluster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$500,000</a> from federally-funded Supercluster Scale AI to improve the service of its automated public chatbot. The system aims to facilitate quick access to information for citizens and allow healthcare professionals to focus on tasks that require their expertise.</p>
<p>iA Financial has been active in the Canadian startup scene, specifically in regards to FinTech investments. The insurance group is an investor in FinTech firms <a href="https://betakit.com/luge-capital-closes-additional-10-million-from-strategics-for-fintech-focused-fund/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Luge Capital</a> and Portag3 Ventures, and has directly backed the likes of <a href="https://betakit.com/fintech-startup-paybright-raises-34-million-in-growth-equity-from-goeasy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PayBright</a> and <a href="https://betakit.com/owl-co-raises-2-5-million-cad-for-encrypted-data-collection-platform/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Owl.co</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kitchener-Waterloo-based EdTech startup <a href="https://www.knowledgehook.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Knowledgehook</a> has partnered with the Ontario Ministry of Education and to deploy its newly-launched remote learning platform in all 72 school districts in the province. </p>
<blockquote><p>“It is also our attempt to maintain normalcy&#8230; during a time where at-home learning is the only learning.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The platform, called Knowledgehook Open Access, is targeted to students in Grades 3 to 10, and helps them continue mathematics education from home through various lessons and exercises. Knowledgehook Open Access assesses student performance against the province’s learning objectives, and provides insights and progress reports to teachers and parents.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This platform is a continuation of our mission to advance math education, and inspire the problem solvers of tomorrow,” said Travis Ratnam, CEO of Knowledgehook. “It is also our attempt to maintain normalcy for students and families, during a time where at-home learning is the only learning.”</p>
<p>Knowledgehook’s flagship platform analyzes student understanding through assessments and offers personalized solutions to close learning gaps between classroom teaching and at-home learning. </p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced schools across Canada to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid-19-coronavirus-ontario-lecce-schools-1.5515855" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">close</a> for the last three months. Publicly-funded schools in Ontario have been closed since March 14 on a ministerial order from Education Minister Stephen Lecce. </p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/top-hat-launches-free-version-of-platform-as-universities-move-to-online-learning/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Top Hat launches free version of platform as universities move to online learning</a></strong></p>
<p>Since then, the province has worked to secure partnerships with the private sector to support home learning during the school closures. Before endorsing Knowledgehook’s platform, the province <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/edu/en/2020/04/ontario-establishes-key-partnerships-to-make-home-learning-more-accessible.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">partnered</a> with Rogers Communications and Apple to purchase iPad devices with free Rogers LTE wireless data that allows students to access the province’s at-home learning curriculum, which <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-at-home-learning-program-launches-today-1.5522788" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched</a> April 6.</p>
<p>“As students become more digitally-inclined, our ministry has been investigating EdTech tools to support teaching and learning,” said Lecce. “Learning online is vital which is why we’re proud to partner with Knowledgehook, an Ontario-based company trusted by many educators and school districts across the province, to provide more educational opportunities to even more students.”</p>
<p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford <a href="https://www.cp24.com/news/ford-says-decision-on-ontario-schools-coming-early-next-week-1.4934258" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Monday that his government will make announcements “early next week” about when licenced childcare and public schools can reopen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shopify is set to make its contactless payments hardware, Shopify Tap &#038; Chip Card Reader, available to Canadian merchants.</p>
<p>The Tap &#038; Chip reader was officially launched last April, though only to Shopify merchants in the United States. Shopify making the reader available in Canada is part of the e-commerce giant’s plan to bring contactless payments hardware to retail stores that are beginning to re-open amid COVID-19.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’ve been working hard to roll out a bunch of things quicker than usual.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The hardware device allows businesses to offer ‘tap’ payment options like credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. The device has also been updated to support contactless Interac Flash.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shopify has made a number of announcements about Canadian product launches of late, many of which led up to the release of its <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-sees-47-percent-revenue-growth-in-q1-2020-amid-impacts-of-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">financial results for Q1 2020</a>. Over the past few weeks, the Ottawa-based company launched a consumer-facing mobile assistant <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-launches-consumer-facing-shopping-assistant-app/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shopping app</a>, globally launched its email marketing tool, <a href="https://betakit.com/shopifys-email-marketing-tool-shopify-email-launches-globally/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shopify Email</a>, and revealed a “fully rebuilt and reimagined” <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-launches-new-pos-connecting-brick-and-mortar-with-online-sales/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shopify POS</a> system.</p>
<p>In April, Shopify also finally brought its small business loan fund, Shopify Capital, <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-capital-launches-in-canada-to-provide-small-business-loans-to-merchants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to Canada</a>, after adding <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-capital-makes-additional-200-million-available-to-merchants-affected-by-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$200 million</a> to the fund to help businesses affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Arpan Podduturi, director of product and retail at Shopify, told BetaKit that COVID-19 has accelerated a number of Shopify’s product launches.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve been working on [the Tap &#038; Chip Card Reader] for a long time, and same with the all-new point-of-sale, but we felt like we really wanted to accelerate it given COVID,” he said. “We felt like it&#8217;s our obligation as partners with our merchants to give them all the technology that we can as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve been working hard to roll out a bunch of things quicker than usual. The retail kit is one of those accelerated launches,” he added. </p>
<p>Podduturi also stated that Shopify’s strategy has always been a multi-channel approach, but the current pandemic made multi-channel more of a necessity for businesses.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-begins-expansion-of-fulfillment-network-to-canadian-merchants-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shopify begins expansion of fulfillment network to Canadian merchants amid COVID-19</a></strong></p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2020, ending March 31, Shopify tracked a 47 percent year-over-year increase in total revenue, despite COVID-19 lockdowns hitting in mid-March. Shopify’s Q1 results also highlighted the strain COVID-19 has put on small and medium-sized businesses, tracking a shifting trend of consumers spending online versus in-store. </p>
<p>Between March 13 and April 24, the e-commerce company saw a 71 percent decline in gross merchandise volume (GMV) through its point-of-sale (POS) channel as most of Shopify’s retail merchants suspended in-store operations. According to Shopify, its merchants managed to replace 94 percent of lost POS GMV with online sales during that same period.</p>
<p>Launching its new POS system earlier this month to more easily connect online and brick-and-mortar, Shopify noted that between March 13 and April 24 it saw an increase in retail store merchants adapting to social-distance selling. Twenty-six of Shopify&#8217;s brick-and-mortar merchants are now offering local delivery or buy-online-pickup-in-store compared to two percent at the end of February.</p>
<p>Shopify has been on a multi-year mission to <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-expands-retail-presence-as-company-fights-for-heart-and-soul-of-commerce/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expand</a> its brick-and-mortar retail presence. The latest POS and Canadian offerings follow a <a href="https://betakit.com/new-physical-space-services-marketplace-lead-flurry-of-shopify-unite-announcements/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spotlight</a> on a number of Shopify&#8217;s POS and payments platform services during Unite 2018, where the company also revealed new services for brick-and-mortar merchants.</p>
<p>“We don&#8217;t think the brick-and-mortar stores are going away, we think that they&#8217;re just really changing, and so the trends of local pickup and delivery, of being able to find items quickly around you, and save on shipping, these are things that we think are going to be around for a very long time,” Podduturi told BetaKit. “Stores are going to have to sort of reboot and reformat for the new retail reality and Shopify point-of-sale is really the best tool that allows them to do that because it integrates deeply into Shopify.”</p>
<p>Available to Canadian retailers using Shopify POS, the Tap &#038; Chip reader is fully integrated with Shopify Payments, so merchants can also track and manage online and in-store financials.</p>
<p>Shopify is also set to offer its Tap &#038; Chip reader as part of the City of Toronto’s <a href="https://betakit.com/city-leading-toronto-tech-initiative-to-get-local-small-businesses-online/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent initiative</a> to help independent businesses build and optimize online stores for free. </p>
<p>As a founding partner of Digital Main Street and City of Toronto’s ShopHERE program, Shopify is set to help build and launch 3,000 online stores over the next three months. The company will also provide training for business owners and volunteers who are building the stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The City of Edmonton&#8217;s Council has unanimously voted to form a new innovation entity independent of the Edmonton Economic Development Corporation (EEDC).</p>
<p>The approval came Monday after the Council reviewed a proposed structure and governance model for the new organization, oulined in a report <a href="https://betakit.com/city-of-edmonton-to-discuss-proposed-model-for-new-innovation-entity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made public last week</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our city’s innovation ecosystem has been under the microscope for long enough and it’s’ now time to push ahead.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The move is part of a restructuring of the EEDC, a not-for-profit agency owned by the City of Edmonton, that operated Innovate Edmonton, Edmonton Tourism, the Edmonton Convention Centre, and the Edmonton EXPO Centre. The EEDC will now be more focused on tourism and conventions.</p>
<p>The Council has now set aside $5 million per year starting in 2021 to fund the new organization. Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson confirmed that this is essentially a $1.2 million increase in spending for the City&#8217;s innovation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our city&#8217;s innovation ecosystem has been under the microscope for long enough and it&#8217;s&#8217; now time to push ahead and send a signal to this community, its funders and entrepreneurs,&#8221; said Iveson in a briefing on Monday. &#8220;Let me be clear, from here on in this is how we are going to do things.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the mayor noted there may be room for improvement in the future, Edmonton will now look to recruit a board and CEO for the innovation entity.</p>
<p>The report presented to Council today offered up a structure and governance model for the entity, which it called Edmonton Innovates. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’ll boldly say today is historic for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/YEG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#YEG</a>. Our city leaders have unanimously decided to fundamentally change how we take on economic development. Innovation and technology are the heart of our future prosperity &#8211; embraced by all. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/yegcc?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#yegcc</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ableg?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ableg</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Cheryll Watson (@CheryllYEG) <a href="https://twitter.com/CheryllYEG/status/1259913985651929094?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The City&#8217;s innovation agenda had previously been driven by Innovate Edmonton, a division of the EEDC, which supports startups and scaleups through networking, resources, and funding. Innovate Edmonton’s partner organizations include Startup Edmonton, Advanced Technology Centre, which supports growth-stage companies, and business accelerator TEC Edmonton; all of which fell under EEDC.</p>
<p>Last month, as part of broader COVID-related <a href="https://betakit.com/innovate-edmonton-loses-vp-director-of-strategy-as-edmonton-economic-development-corporation-makes-covid-19-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">layoffs</a> and downsizing by EEDC, Innovate Edmonton lost key members of its leadership team, including vice president Cheryll Watson and Alexandra Hryciw, director of strategy and stakeholder relations.</p>
<p>While it was originally thought that the new innovation entity could be the umbrella organization for Innovate Edmonton, TEC Edmonton, and Startup Edmonton, the future of those groups is unclear based on the report and today&#8217;s approval. Innovate Edmonton has been heavily affected by EEDC&#8217;s COVID-19 layoffs and reductions; since Watson and Hryciw were laid off the team has lost additional staff and is now reportedly down to around 13 employees from a previous 21.</p>
<p>Startup Edmonton is set to be moved into the new entity and continue offering its programming. Iveson noted that Startup Edmonton &#8220;will pass over to the new entity as soon as it can,&#8221; adding that the board and CEO will have the option to evaluate and make adjustments to the programming.</p>
<p>He said, for time being Startup Edmonton remains an important program and even as the brand equity is set to be assessed by the new entity, he said Startup Edmonton as a brand communicates the City&#8217;s desire to be a player in the tech space.</p>
<p>The notice to begin recruiting the new entity&#8217;s board is set to go out later this week. The mayor added that the board&#8217;s first task will be to recruit a CEO, with hopes that the new innovation organization will be &#8220;up and running&#8221; later this year.</p>
<p>Cheryll Watson, who is still involved in Edmonton&#8217;s innovation ecosystem, serving on the board of Startup Genome, told BetaKit she is pleased to see how quickly the City is moving.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all recognize that the City is moving as quickly as they can and even their ambition to post the board positions this week is a demonstration of them being probably more agile than they&#8217;ve been in the past,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She expressed concern, however, that Edmonton is still going to have a gap in its innovation sector. She acknowledged the City is working hard on a transition plan, but wondered whether current progress that has been made by groups such as Innovate Edmonton and Startup Edmonton might be affected.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vancouver-based meal kit delivery service <a href="https://www.freshprep.ca/">Fresh Prep</a> has raised a $7 million CAD Series A round. This funding brings the startup’s total raised to date to over $10 million.</p>
<p>The round was led by <a href="http://www.renewalfunds.com/">Renewal Funds</a>, a sustainability-focused venture capital firm, and received support from undisclosed strategic and existing investors. Fresh Prep said the additional capital will allow the company to hire more employees and “increase automation” of its technology. Genevieve Pinto, partner at Renewal Funds, has joined Fresh Prep’s board of directors. </p>
<blockquote><p>“We pride ourselves on being a fully vertically-integrated food company that is strongly enabled by technology and innovation.”<br />
&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>“Our growth to date has been a result of automation and a focus on our customers,” said Becky Brauer, co-CEO and co-founder of Fresh Prep. “We’ve been able to optimize margins and constantly improve our product and service through our focus on technology and innovation.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2015 by Brauer, co-CEO Dhruv Sood, and Husein Rahemtulla, Fresh Prep uses a subscription-based model to deliver meal kits in reusable cooler bags with locally-sourced, pre-chopped ingredients.</p>
<p>Fresh Prep calls itself a “vertically-integrated” company, meaning it owns most of its supply chain. While sourcing food from local farmers, Fresh Prep prepares the food product for the meal kits itself and employs its own delivery drivers. The service is currently offered throughout British Columbia’s Lower Mainland, the Okanagan, as well as Vancouver Island. Fresh Prep has over 300 employees and services tens of thousands of customers across municipal BC. </p>

<p>“We pride ourselves on being a fully vertically-integrated food company that is strongly enabled by technology and innovation in logistics, which gives us access to real-time tracking,” said Sood.</p>
<p>Fresh Prep claims its revenue has increased 11,000 percent since the company launched. The startup said the COVID-19 pandemic is driving increased interest in the meal kit industry, adding that it has been able to adapt to provide uninterrupted service to its customers</p>
<p>Food delivery services have seen a <a href="https://kerry.com/insights/kerrydigest/2020/food-delivery-in-demand-during-covid-19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surge</a> in demand in recent months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Spud, another food delivery company that recently <a href="https://betakit.com/e-grocery-tech-project-receives-250000-from-digital-technology-supercluster-to-build-provincial-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">partnered</a> with the Digital Technology Supercluster on an e-grocery project, told Global News it is also <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6819081/bc-delivery-services-boom-business-coronavirus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struggling</a> to keep up with demand. One company that has not been able to stay competitive is Foodora, which last month <a href="https://betakit.com/foodora-to-cease-operations-in-canada-citing-highly-saturated-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed</a> its business in Canada after five years of operation.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to partner with an innovative business that not only advances our mission of supporting technology and consumer products companies that are good for people and the planet, but also one that has been rapidly growing, while demonstrating profitability,” said Renewal Funds’ Pinto. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The City of Toronto is set to announce a new program, <a href="https://digitalmainstreet.ca/shophere/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ShopHERE</a>, aimed at helping Toronto’s independent businesses build and optimize online stores at no cost, BetaKit has learned.</p>
<p>Launched in conjunction with <a href="https://digitalmainstreet.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Main Street</a>, a program of the Toronto Association of Business Improvement Areas, the initiative will also receive support from Toronto&#8217;s technology community.</p>
<blockquote><p>Web developers from Toronto tech will build and launch 3,000 online stores over the next three months.</p></blockquote>
<p>ShopHERE&#8217;s goal is to help local independent small businesses and artists that currently do not have the resources to build an online store. Web developers from a number of Toronto tech companies will build and launch 3,000 online stores through the program over the next three months.</p>
<p>To be eligible for ShopHERE, businesses must pay commercial property taxes in Toronto, and have fewer than 10 employees (or fewer than 25 employees if they are a cafe, restaurant, or bar). The businesses also cannot be part of a corporate chain or franchise. The City estimates there are 49,051 businesses in Toronto that fit these eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>Global Skills Hub, Scotiabank, and General Assembly have all committed staff as development volunteers, along with TribalScale, FreshBooks, BrainStation, and Juno. Students from Toronto&#8217;s Schulich School of Business will also assist with training and assistance with digital marketing, shipping, and operations, with support from the City and Magnet.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/digital-main-street-launches-across-ontario-to-help-small-businesses-adopt-digital-practices/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Main Street launches across Ontario to help small businesses adopt digital practices</a></strong></p>
<p>Several global tech companies have also signed on to support the initiative, including Shopify, which is offering templates for online stores, as well as training and support for businesses. Other companies, like Microsoft, Facebook, Google, eBay, eShipper and Mastercard, will provide support through free ad credits or cybersecurity software. Mastercard, for example, is providing small businesses with free cybersecurity assessments through its subsidiary, <a href="https://www.riskrecon.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RiskRecon</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Helping business owners navigate today’s challenges is our number one priority and we’re excited to continue working with Digital Main Street and the City of Toronto,&#8221; Satish Kanwar, vice president of product at Shopify, told BetaKit. &#8220;ShopHERE will open virtual doors for local businesses by setting them up with online stores built on Shopify, and helping future-proof their business by creating an omnichannel experience.”</p>
<p>Those interested in volunteering their time can sign up individually or as part of a company.</p>
<p>The initiative will launch in mid-May, with the City hoping to add 1,000 stores per month from June to August. Businesses will be able to choose the template for their online store, customized with their information and branding.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re focused on Toronto small businesses and artists right now, but we’re always open to collaboration with our partners across Canada to expand important programs like ShopHERE.”<br />
&#8211; Chris Rickett</p></blockquote>
<p>The launch of ShopHERE follows Chris Rickett, the former manager of entrepreneurship services at the City of Toronto, <a href="https://betakit.com/city-of-toronto-reclaims-startup-lead-as-it-restructures-to-better-fight-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">returning to</a> the municipality. In early April, Rickett was named an acting director to support both Main Street and startup businesses in Toronto as they struggle to outlast the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Since Rickett’s return, the City has launched an <a href="https://betakit.com/tech-entrepreneurs-launch-donation-platform-to-help-canadian-local-businesses-affected-by-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">online donation platform</a> created by a group of tech entrepreneurs allowing the public to make direct donations to local small businesses across Canada. The platform, called Distantly, is aimed to cover businesses’ overhead costs as they weather the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>When asked about plans to take ShopHERE across the province or nationally, Rickett told BetaKit no such plans were currently in place, but added: </p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re focused on Toronto small businesses and artists right now, but we&#8217;re always open to collaboration with our partners across Canada to expand important programs like ShopHERE.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toronto Mayor John Tory is expected to announce the program later today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Real estate firm Colliers International and Techstars have announced the 2020 Colliers Proptech Accelerator program, which helps proptech startups fine-tune business plans and explore pilots and partnerships, has been moved to 2021. </p>
<blockquote><p>“There is more incredible innovation coming and I am excited to see it reflected in next year’s cohort.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The organization said the decision to postpone the Toronto-based accelerator was made due to considerations regarding the health and safety of program participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. The accelerator’s last cohort <a href="https://betakit.com/three-canadian-startups-selected-to-participate-in-colliers-proptech-accelerator/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">began</a> in September 2019 and ended in December. </p>
<p>“Our commitment to the Colliers Proptech Accelerator is unwavering. [Managing director of Techstars] Ben Liao and Techstars will continue to build and enhance the program across multiple fronts through 2020 in partnership with Colliers, with the goal of making 2021 the best year yet,” said Zach Michaud, vice president of strategic investments at Colliers International.</p>
<p>Rather than hosting a new cohort for this year, Colliers said it is working with its 2018 and 2019 alumni companies to deliver virtual tools that help people and businesses navigate the new challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has surfaced. Michaud said digital tools, developed by companies like Finneo, RealAR, and Booqed, could give Colliers’ clients an edge in the current business environment.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/proptech-startup-doorr-raises-1-75-million-seed-round/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Proptech startup Doorr raises $1.75 million seed round</a></strong></p>
<p>“As COVID-19 accelerates the commercial real estate industry’s transition to digital solutions, we are seeing the potential benefits of our partnerships move into sharper focus,” said Michaud. “The business tools they are providing such as lease abstraction, virtual office tours, and workplace occupancy analytics give our experts and clients a competitive advantage in these challenging times.”</p>
<p>Colliers and Techstars join the many accelerator programs that have opted to postpone or virtually host their programming due to the pandemic. Techstars’ <a href="https://betakit.com/techstars-to-hold-startup-weekend-virtually-as-it-shifts-event-focus-to-covid-19-solutions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Startup Weekend</a> was held virtually last month, and <a href="https://betakit.com/11-startups-to-pitch-at-next-canadas-virtual-venture-reveal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NEXT Canada</a> is also hosting its Venture Reveal on Zoom this week. Techstars has plans to run other accelerator programs virtually, with details on different terms and cohorts <a href="https://www.techstars.com/covid#accelerator-program-updates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>All of Techstars’ global programs running from June to September will be held virtually with a virtual demo day. The organization is also implementing virtual committees and screenings for future cohorts and plans to reassess when live events or meetings will be held in person. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The federal government announced Monday it will provide new <a href="https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2020/05/11/prime-minister-announces-additional-support-businesses-help-save" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">emergency financing</a> to large and medium-sized businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, and is expanding the Business Credit Availability Program (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/economic-response-plan.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BCAP</a>) to support these firms.</p>
<blockquote><p>Under the expanded BCAP, eligible businesses can receive loans of up to $60 million per company, and guarantees of up to $80 million.<br />
&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the government will establish the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility (LEEFF), a program to provide bridge financing to Canada’s largest employers affected by COVID-19. </p>
<p>The LEEFF is aimed to help large firms protect Canadian employees and avoid bankruptcies of “otherwise viable firms” during the economic downturn. The program is specifically targeted to firms whose needs are not being met through conventional financing.</p>
<p>The LEEFF program will be open to large for-profit businesses, but will not be available for those in the financial sector or not-for-profit businesses like airports, with annual revenues of $300 million or higher. Morneau noted that the program is open to all sectors, pointing to companies such as airlines and those in the oil and gas sector.</p>
<p>To qualify for LEEFF support, eligible businesses must be seeking financing of about $60 million or more, have &#8220;significant operations or workforce&#8221; inside Canada, and cannot be involved in active insolvency proceedings.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during his daily briefing that this program is &#8220;not a gift&#8221; to large corporations. He stated that the LEEFF is about protecting jobs for individuals and making sure that businesses don&#8217;t go bankrupt because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The government said the LEEFF will require &#8220;strict limits&#8221; to dividends, share buy-backs, and executive pay. Businesses must demonstrate how they intend to preserve employment and maintain investment activities in order to receive support. Recipients will need to commit to collective bargaining agreements and protect workers’ pensions.</p>

<p>To access the funding, companies are also required to commit to publish annual climate-related disclosure reports consistent with the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. The climate-related disclosure should include how future operations will support environmental sustainability and national climate goals.</p>
<p>Support through LEEFF will be deployed by the Canada Development Investment Corporation, in cooperation with Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, and the Department of Finance. The government said it is in the &#8220;final stages of establishing the program,&#8221; and that further information about the application process will be provided soon.</p>
<h3>BCAP expanded to help mid-sized firms</h3>
<p>As part of its support, the government is also expanding BCAP to help mid-sized companies with larger financing needs. Eligible businesses will be able to receive loans of up to $60 million per company, and guarantees of up to $80 million.</p>
<p>Until now, BCAP was targeted toward small and medium-sized businesses. It consisted of a <a href="https://betakit.com/applications-for-emergency-co-lending-begin-to-open-as-bdc-finalizes-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">co-lending program</a> through the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) and a <a href="https://betakit.com/some-banks-begin-rollout-of-edc-loan-guarantee-for-canadian-businesses/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">loan guarantee</a> through Export Development Canada (EDC). Both BDC and EDC are deploying these programs through financial institutions like banks and credit unions.</p>
<p>“We know that Canadian workers and companies of all sizes are facing economic hardship and uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic,&#8221; said Minister of Innovation, Science, and Industry Navdeep Bains.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to analyze the specific pain points that COVID-19 is putting on all our industrial sectors as they grapple with unprecedented financial difficulties during this crisis,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The measures we are announcing today will add to the supports currently available to large employers in Canada to help them weather the storm during this difficult time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government said it will also continue to provide funding to businesses through Farm Credit Canada, BDC, and EDC. No further details were provided.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How are you doing?</p>
<p>This standard rhetorical greeting has taken on a deeper meaning in recent weeks. COVID-19 has upturned how we live and how we work. And with our baseline sense of wellbeing in constant flux, our reflexive answer &#8211; “fine” &#8211; just doesn’t seem to cut it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A change curve reflects the common psychological states one encounters in crisis.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>As an entrepreneur or manager, you are not only dealing with your own fluctuating emotions, or your family’s feelings, you must also help your team navigate these turbulent times. In a time of virtual Zoom meetings, exponential pandemic curves and a constant barrage of breaking news, it is easy to feel anxious and overwhelmed. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are limited tools to help teams communicate through crises. Frequent video check-ins are a good place to start, but they may end up being counter-productive if they don’t offer a mechanism to truly gauge your team’s wellbeing. </p>
<p>One of the most effective references for managing a team through crisis is a change curve. </p>
<p>Based on work done by researchers over the years, a change curve reflects the common psychological states one encounters in crisis. From initial shock and denial, the curve then plummets into a valley of grief, before moving on to acceptance and, as morale improves, a steady climb up the slope of exploration and creativity. </p>
<p>These same curves can also help organizations manage restructurings or mergers and acquisitions. Teams, companies &#8211; even cities and countries &#8211; may see their current psychology reflected back to them on some portion of this curve.</p>

<p>A change curve provides everyone with an easy framework to label and describe how they are really feeling. The identified stage is not always accurate and certainly not precise but the entire team gets a relatively clear understanding of where everyone’s head is at. </p>
<p>Using this curve as a frame of reference identifies team members who are stuck in the valley of anger or grief. As a manager, these are the members of your team who may need additional support (there are valuable mental health resources available to help individuals get through this pandemic). </p>
<p>Teams can also use the curve as a way to describe how they are feeling as a collective. This can provide an opportunity for collaborative problem solving and brainstorming around how to move the team along the x-axis trajectory.</p>

<p>It is necessary to note that the curve is not prescriptive and progression through the stages is not linear &#8211; an individual or team may experience multiple stages at once, not experience some of the stages at all, fall back on a previous stage, go through the cycle multiple times a day, experience different stages as a team versus as an individual and experience different stages in their personal and professional lives. It is more important to use the curve as a descriptive tool that enables everyone on the team to share, have their feelings validated and learn how others are dealing with this shared experience.</p>
<p>A leader’s role in such a discussion is to create an emotionally safe space where team members feel comfortable discussing where they are on the curve. One of the best ways to achieve that is to start the discussion by being vulnerable and sharing what they are feeling, openly.</p>
<p>Unlike those past responses that ring hollow (“fine, thanks”), a change curve provides the language to truly check-in on yourself and the people you care about.</p>
<p>But this curve offers more than just a shared vocabulary. It also illustrates the familiar emotional journey humans confront in a crisis. No matter where you see yourself on this curve, you can take heart knowing we&#8217;re all on a similar path, navigating historical change together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month, 11 Canadian ventures will be showcased at the NEXT Venture Reveal, formerly known as Prototype Day. This year, the event will be held virtually through Zoom on May 11. </p>
<blockquote><p>”We are optimistic about the massive impact entrepreneurs will have on our future economy.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nextcanada.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NEXT Canada</a> provides entrepreneurs with access to capital, education, mentorship, and networking in order to build and scale a company through its accelerator programs. Although only 11 startups will pitch, this year’s event will reveal the 80 ventures that will join the <a href="https://www.nextcanada.com/next-36/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Next 36</a>, <a href="https://www.nextcanada.com/next-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Next AI</a>, and <a href="https://www.nextcanada.com/next-founders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Next Founders</a> programs, and will also match founders to mentors and investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.fingerfoodatg.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Finger Food</a> Advanced Technology Group (ATG), a Port Coquitlam, British Columbia-based firm that builds custom tech solutions using artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, and blockchain, has been acquired by <a href="https://unity.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Unity Technologies</a>, which is based in the United States. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;Together we will provide the solutions and services all businesses need to get their RT3D visions off the ground.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Finger Food ATG will join Unity Industrial, a division that develops and deploys scalable real-time 3D (RT3D) solutions and services across multiple industries. Unity will retain all members of Finger Food ATG, approximately 200 people, in order to drive RT3D adoption. RT3D is a sub-field of computer graphics focused on producing and analyzing images in real-time.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>“By joining the Unity family, we will have more access to Unity’s extensive engineering team to help shape the future of their platform by sharing the trends and needs that we’re seeing across our customer base,” said Ryan Peterson, CEO of Finger Food ATG.</p>
<p>Launched in 2009, Finger Food ATG employs engineers, designers, artists, and developers, and partners with clients to custom-make solutions. One of its more recent partnerships was with Lego, where Finger Food ATG built an immersive app for the company. In September, the company <a href="https://betakit.com/finger-food-receives-3-5-million-from-opportunity-calgary-investment-fund-for-new-office/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opened</a> a Calgary facility and received $3.5 million in funding from the Opportunity Calgary Investment Fund. Other clients include Lowe’s, Enbridge, and Softbank Robotics.</p>

<p>Finger Food ATG is hoped to provide Unity’s enterprise customers with design, development, and deployment services, such as interactive, digital versions of real-world assets like manufactured products and buildings. </p>
<p>The companies aim to translate shared programs into repeatable solutions, so that enterprise companies across any industry can use RT3D without needing to ramp up internal expertise, retraining, or changing established processes.</p>
<p>“Over the last two years, we’ve made meaningful traction deploying our industry-leading RT3D platform typically known for game development into industries such as media and entertainment, automotive and transportation, and architecture and construction,” said Dave Rhodes, senior vice president and general manager of Unity. </p>
<p>“Finger Food has already had a lot of success applying RT3D to these industries and others, solving customers’ hardest problems,” Rhodes added. “Together we will provide the solutions and services all businesses need to get their RT3D visions off the ground.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The federal government is establishing an Industry Strategy Council, aimed to allow industry members to share challenges faced by different sectors across Canada’s economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<blockquote><p>The council will be chaired by Monique Leroux, former president of Desjardins.</p></blockquote>
<p>This council will act as an advisory board to assess COVID-19&#8217;s impact on industries and broaden the government&#8217;s understanding of specific sectoral pressures. The government will bring on senior business leaders to communicate with the government as it assesses economic policy. </p>
<p>The council is also expected to build on the federal government’s existing model for collaboration between industry and government, known as the <a href="http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/098.nsf/eng/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Economic Strategy Tables</a>. These tables are chaired by senior industry members from advanced manufacturing, health and biosciences, agri-food, cleantech, digital industries, tourism, and resources sectors. </p>
<p>In a Friday press conference with Canada’s federal ministers, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Navdeep Bains announced that two new tables will be added in order to serve Canada’s retail and transportation sectors. These tables are being added in response to “particular pressures related to the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Bains said the government is attempting to take a “proactive and strategic approach” in bringing the private sector to understand the “scope and depth” of sectoral challenges. </p>
<p>&#8220;By leveraging the existing and trusted Economic Strategy Tables, the Industry Strategy Council will provide a forum for industry leaders to share their perspectives regarding the challenges they are facing as a result of COVID-19,” said Bains. </p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/what-canadian-provinces-are-doing-to-support-businesses-amid-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">What Canadian provinces are doing to support businesses amid COVID-19</a></strong></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We know that Canadian workers across numerous industrial sectors are facing economic hardship and uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic. We need to fully understand these challenges in order to continue to support Canadian workers.</p>
<p>&mdash; Navdeep Bains (@NavdeepSBains) <a href="https://twitter.com/NavdeepSBains/status/1258794348550008832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Over the next 90 days, the council will meet regularly to identify and understand sectoral pressures that are common across the industries. The council will be chaired by Monique Leroux, former president of Desjardins, and other members of the council will be announced in the coming days. </p>
<p>“Monique Leroux has one of the most distinguished careers in Canadian finance, and her impressive background makes her the ideal business leader to chair this council,” Bains said. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The federal government has extended the <a href="https://betakit.com/here-are-the-final-details-on-the-canada-emergency-wage-subsidy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy</a> (CEWS) program beyond June. The extension is aimed to encourage employers to re-hire workers laid off as a result of COVID-19, and “help kickstart the reopening of the country’s economy.” </p>
<blockquote><p>The first payments from the 75 percent wage subsidy were expected to be received this week.</p></blockquote>
<p>In his daily press briefing, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said since the CEWS launched last week, employers have applied for the 75 percent subsidy for more than 2 million workers. He added that this subsidy would play a more significant role as provinces begin to open their economies. The first payments from the CEWS were expected to be received this week. </p>
<p>The CEWS was originally available for three months and was set to end on June 6. The prime minister did not specify how much longer the wage subsidy would be available, simply noting it will be available beyond June.</p>
<p>“To businesses hit by COVID-19, the wage subsidy will continue to be there for you to help you keep your employees on the payroll,” Trudeau said. “And if you had to let people go, try to bring them back. It’s those workers who will drive our economy’’s short and long-term recovery.”</p>
<p>The CEWS offers a subsidy of 75 percent of an eligible employee’s weekly earnings, to a maximum of $847 per employee per week to eligible employers, for up to 12 weeks. The funding is retroactive to March 15. The government said businesses can generally expect to receive their payment within 10 business days if they are registered for direct deposit on their payroll account.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://betakit.com/minister-joly-says-details-on-rda-funding-expected-soon-discusses-federal-support-of-tech-sector/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Minister Joly says details on RDA funding expected soon, discusses federal support of tech sector</a></strong></p>
<p>The extension of the wage subsidy follows Statistics Canada releasing its monthly jobs <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410028703" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>, which found about 2 million Canadians lost their jobs in April. Unemployment soared to 13 percent, up from March’s rate of 7.8 percent. The total number of Canadians that have filed for unemployment since the COVID-19 hit Canada has reached 3 million. </p>
<p>While some from the startup and tech community have <a href="https://betakit.com/waterloo-tech-companies-join-demands-for-wage-subsidy-modifications-in-letter-to-feds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticized</a> the federal program’s revenue criteria, a survey conducted by the Council of Canadian Innovators found the <a href="https://betakit.com/feds-work-to-revise-wage-subsidy-but-canadian-tech-says-it-needs-more/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expanded criteri</a>a passed by Parliament in early April could allow more startups to access the subsidy. The survey found that nearly 40 percent could be ineligible for the wage subsidy, compared to 94 percent of companies that said they would be ineligible prior to the expanded criteria.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Edmonton’s City Council is set to discuss a proposed structure and governance model for a new organization that will be responsible for advancing the innovation ecosystem within the city.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Edmonton has a tremendous opportunity to continue to build on the strengths of an active and creative entrepreneurship ecosystem.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Last Fall, the City entered into a process to explore creating municipally-funded tech innovation entities, independent of the Edmonton Economic Development Corporation (EEDC). The latest report on the effort was made public on Thursday. The report provides details on what this new innovation entity would look like and how the transition would take place.</p>
<p>EEDC is a not-for-profit agency owned by the City of Edmonton. It operates Innovate Edmonton, Edmonton Tourism, the Edmonton Convention Centre, and the Edmonton EXPO Centre. Edmonton’s city council voted in December to change the EEDC’s mandate, scaling back the organization’s responsibilities and separating out Innovate Edmonton and Startup Edmonton.</p>
<p>The latest report has offered up a structure and governance model for the new innovation entity, which it calls Edmonton Innovates. The report also provides details on Edmonton’s “economic development enablers,” the overall goal of economic development, and outlines how this change to a new innovation entity could be realized.</p>
<p>“Edmonton has a tremendous opportunity to continue to build on the strengths of an active and creative entrepreneurship ecosystem by creating a purpose driven innovation entity,” the report stated. “This entity will support the ecosystem with focused programs and services and a funding mechanism. The work of this entity will be even more important in a post COVID world where innovation and diversification are key to a more resilient local economy.”</p>

<p>The report added that the new Edmonton Innovates will build “a stronger and supportive ecosystem by injecting capital that will be matched by investors” and will work with “technology entities and stakeholders” to coordinate programs and start new initiatives aimed at increasing the number of startups in Edmonton.</p>
<p>Currently, the City’s innovation is driven by Innovate Edmonton, a division of the EEDC, which supports startups and scaleups through networking, resources, and funding. Innovate Edmonton’s partner organizations include Startup Edmonton, Advanced Technology Centre, which supports growth-stage companies, and business accelerator TEC Edmonton; all of which currently fall under EEDC.</p>
<p>Last month, as part of broader COVID-related <a href="https://betakit.com/innovate-edmonton-loses-vp-director-of-strategy-as-edmonton-economic-development-corporation-makes-covid-19-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">layoffs and downsizing</a> by EEDC, Innovate Edmonton lost key members of its leadership team, including vice president Cheryll Watson and Alexandra Hryciw, director of strategy and stakeholder relations.</p>
<p>While it was originally thought that the new innovation entity could be the umbrella organization for Innovate Edmonton, TEC Edmonton, and Startup Edmonton, the future of those groups is unclear based on the report.</p>
<p>The report does not acknowledge Innovate Edmonton and at this time it is not clear if the group and its team will be part of the new Edmonton Innovates, or if there will be a new organization entirely.</p>

<p>The report noted that innovation programs offered by Startup Edmonton should be moved into the new entity and evaluated. Startup Edmonton brand equity, the report said, should be assessed, along with a determination of whether it can be leveraged in the Edmonton Innovates.</p>

<p>The report adds that there is also an opportunity to work with existing innovation entities such as Edmonton Screen Industries Office, Health City, and the University of Alberta (through TEC Edmonton), to review programming, streamline functions, and reduce duplication.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The new innovation entity will support and coordinate Edmonton’s innovation community&#8230;using a more integrated approach than in the past.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The report recommends the City administration begin to create the new innovation entity and outlines the process of recruiting eight directors for its board. The recommendations and government model were sourced from engagement with stakeholders from Edmonton’s innovation ecosystem, which included Innovate Edmonton, Startup Edmonton, entrepreneurs, universities, provincial and federal governments, and more.</p>
<p>The report also recommends that the mandate of the new innovation entity be to “optimize resources and leverage talent within Edmonton to diversify the economy, allowing innovation to become a major economic driver in Edmonton.” The idea, said the report, is to create an agile, lean, accountable, and community-focused group that provides a range of services and programming, including the operation of a new venture fund.</p>
<p>The fund would be an estimated $5 million to $10 million, said the report, with the exact amount and source of funding to be determined by the CEO and board.</p>

<p>The report notes that the Edmonton City Council, “as representative of the sole shareholder, will<br />
appoint board members and receive annual reports from the organization.” The City’s council and administration, as well as Edmonton Global, and “sector-specific mentors and business advisors” will all have input into Edmonton Innovates. The organization’s recommended structure would include a board, CEO, and an entrepreneur advisory committee.</p>
<p>Edmonton City Council is set to discuss the report on Monday and it is expected they will vote on recommendations. With Edmonton council’s approval, the City’s Administration will set up Edmonton Innovates over a five-month period. The report notes that “the current COVID-19 situation may require this timeline to be extended.”</p>

<p>The five-year plan would see Edmonton Innovates created this year as a non-profit corporation. In 2020 the recruitment of board members and a CEO would also take place. </p>
<p>Once the entity is established and structures set in place, “the innovate Edmonton component of EEDC will be reviewed for alignment with the mandate of the new entity and moved,” stated the report. In 2021, the new entity would start developing the venture fund and work to create partnerships with other local innovation organizations.</p>
<p>“Edmonton’s active and creative entrepreneurship ecosystem is underpinned by a number of existing technology related entities,” the report stated. “These entities have successfully supported growth in the health, artificial intelligence and agri-tech sectors and show significant potential to encourage growth in other sectors.”</p>
<p>“The purpose of the new innovation entity is to support Edmonton’s interconnected and evolving ecosystem,” it added. “The new innovation entity will support and coordinate Edmonton’s innovation community after the pandemic emergency to encourage and support investors, entrepreneurs and scale-ups using a more integrated approach than in the past.”</p>
